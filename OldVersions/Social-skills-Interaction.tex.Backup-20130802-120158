\section*{Abstract} 
Social and emotional skills refer to range of interpersonal and life skills that are crucial for virtually all our interactions in everyday life. Teaching and learning such skills has a long history, with a large number of evidence-based programs across many domains such as education, business, medical or therapeutic contexts. 

However, very little technology gets used in these programs, despite its potential to fundamentally enhance and complement the existing approaches.  
%
%Primary aim of this paper is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills.

Primary aim of this paper is  to provide a foundation and set an agenda
for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help
teach, social and emotional skills. To this end, we review the literature on social and emotional learning courses across various domains, identifying similarities and shared challenges to successful learning. 
We then link these to HCI research, showing the relevance of  various current HCI research  and the potential for both fields to be mutually enriched. 
Our key argument is that much existing HCI work can be directly relevant to social and emotional skills learning (SEL), but that the topic has been under-researched so far. We argue how such technology could fundamentally extend and enhance the possibilities available to social skills curricula designers in other domains, and help address some of the key challenges they face; as well as pose novel opportunities, challenges and well-motivated practical problems for HCI.

% {{{ SECTION -  Introduction
\section{Introduction}
 
 
Social and emotional skills refer to a range of skills that are crucial for our everyday life and healthy development \cite{Weare2011,Adi2009a,Damon2006}. We define the term broadly here to include skills such as those related to emotional intelligence, interpersonal and communication skills, and also skills such as mindfulness, self-control and empathy. The importance of such skills for personal competence and well-being is acknowledged both in research and industry \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Stepien2006,Barth2011,Carey2011,Bono2009}. Social and emotional skills are particularly valued in diverse domains such as education (from kindergarten to university education), leadership, social work, therapy, and medical/clinical settings. 
        %
%       For example, these can be \emph{education} (across all age ranges, i.e., from kindergarden to university education), \emph{workplace related} (ranging from specific soft-skills courses for employees and business students (such as communication, presentation and conflict management skills) to more general approaches such as executive coaching for managers), \emph{medical personell} (communication skills, empathy for students and practitioners), \emph{therapy} related (psychotherapists training and practice, counselling), \emph{mindfulness and calming technology} (novel area, related to stressful environment and problems with work-life balance, with technology partially to blame -- see e.g., workshop or the interactions paper; approaches to support more sustainable lifestyle). 

We see an increasing number of interventions and courses specifically designed to support social and emotional skill learning (SEL) in these areas, substantiated by a large body of peer-reviewed, scientific literature showing that \emph{such skills are teachable} and \emph{interventions can lead to measurable improvements}. For example, \citeN{Durlak2011} reviewed the effects of more than 200 SEL interventions within primary and secondary schools, encompassing more than 270000 students. The calculated effect sizes averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests and %, 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills, as well as 
10\% decrease in classroom misbehaviour, with the effects lasting for at least 6 months after the intervention. However, very little technology gets used in the current curricula, despite its potential to help tackle some of the key challenges present.

%       There is growing interest in similar topics within HCI,   %Moreover, as only very little technology support is used in the interventions and curricula in practice at the moment, it leaves many opportunities (and challenges) for improvement. 

%This potential is further supported by the initial work within HCI research relevant to teaching (or influencing) social and emotional skills, and 
There is also a growing interest in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) on research relevant to teaching or influencing social and emotional skills\footnote{Research on using technology to support learning in more classical academic subjects such as mathematics, programming, physics or languages  has a longer history within HCI, including a number of well-established journals, e.g., Computers \& Education. As further discussed in Section 2.3, while we reference selected articles, we do not review this literature in detail as it is mostly focused on declarative, content-based learning, rather than procedural skills-based learning, which is key for SEL.}. For example, a large body of work has recently focused on autism (e.g., \cite{Escobedo2012,Porayska-Pomsta2011,Zarin2011,Tentori2010,Gotsis2010,Hong2012}), and on using technology to enhance or facilitate therapy \cite{Coyle2011,Matthews2011,DeSa2010,Hancock2010}. Prior literature also includes smaller scale systems aiming to influence particular social behaviour (e.g., discussion dominance, or rapport)  \cite{Narumi2009,Piper2006,Balaam2011,Kim2008,McAtamney2006,Schroyen2008,Kim2008a,Toups2007,Kreitmayer2012,Daily2010}. 
%
%
Wider interest in emotional and social skills within HCI is also exemplified for example by CHI workshops on 'Interaction Design and Emotional Wellbeing' (CHI'12) and 'Patient-Clinician Communication' (CHI'13); as well as a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Work-life Balance.

Given this, it is timely then that the potential of technology to support social and emotional skills training and development is explored in a more systematic way.
        %\rephrase{Aims of this paper -- review and show how this is relevat}
This paper reviews literature across diverse domains, from education to business to medicine, where social and emotional skills teaching is key, and connects these to various related work in HCI. In doing so, the aim is to present a more principled approach to defining a systematic programme of research for HCI in support of SEL. 
%       how HCI approaches and knowledge could be reappropriated and utilised to enhance existing courses and potentially give rise to new ones, making it a promising topic of further research. 
%, building on what has previously been good but isolated work
        
        In particular, we argue that the key challenges to teaching social and emotional skills are similar across all domains and that these raise new opportunities and challenges to HCI research to explore if and how state of the art technologies can help address these challenges, as well as help support SEL more generally. We outline both the methods and topics \Geraldine{G: can these be summarised in a table or fig as hard to get an overall summary picture across all the programs}that social and emotional skills curricula use, drawing out key aspects where HCI involvement would be useful.   Moreover, we argue that although much of existing HCI work was not, so far, connected to social skills training, it is actually highly relevant and could be beneficial for augmenting existing curricula. We then provide a roadmap for further research into this topic, outlining such connections in more detail. 
        % need to CHECK this at the end to see what we actually deliver and whether we can call it a roadmap (or a landscape or agenda or ...?)
The identified connections build on the emphasis that social and emotional skills interventions place on procedural learning, i.e., the need for substantial practice and feedback; they also build on the key importance of the transfer of learned skills from facilitated sessions into everyday real world settings. We argue how supporting these aspects fits well with, and could easily benefit from, existing work on topics within HCI such as ubiquitous computing, social signals processing, behavioural change, and ``into the wild'' research. We also outline how the specifics of the in-class learning environment (facilitated, often in-doors) present a particularly interesting context for design and for initial deployment of new technologies as it provides a real-world setting, in a reasonably controlled environment with access to an expert facilitator. 


\GeraldineFIX{ G: Will need to check these again - that we actually name and address these later as set up here - ubiquitous computing, social signals processing, behavioural change, and \textbf{``into the wild'' research} ... particularly into the wild ... might need to name this as a separate section somehow if it is still important (though don't so many existing programs show that SEL has already done a good job going itw?) P: I think it could be ok now ... there is a section on `Bringing practice into the wild', and out-of-session learning is highlighted as key in many places (e.g., Sec 6.1.2). As for existing SEL programs -- I think they showed some positive effects (i.e., some transfer of skills), but I don't recall any program supporting out-of-session learning in intricate ways (certainly could be improved upon, I think). }

        % These are supporting complex feedback (based on novel sensors etc.), additional practice opportunities (e.g., based on ubiquitous computing or VR type of systems), embedded networks, and the importance of keeping engagement and motivation (links to behavioural change and gamification) with specific examples. 
        


%       Figure~\ref{fig:journalStructure} outlines the structure of the rest of this paper, and provides an overview of the main results. 
The remainder of this paper is divided into six sections. The next section starts with a detailed overview of social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools (Section~\ref{sec:SEL}). We  focus on SEL in education as an exemplary domain given it has the longest  history of both academic research and practical applications, and focuses on the widest range of life skills. %research history, and the skills set taught is broader than any of the other domains. %We argue that it is a good choice as SEL has the longest history of both academic research and practical applications, and focuses on the widest range of life skills.
        Section~\ref{sec:linkDomains} then discusses how the topics and issues found within education extend to other domains such as organisational/workplace settings, medical/clinical/therapeutic settings, and everyday life social and emotional skills. Sections~\ref{sec:summary} to \ref{sec:agenda} identify the key challenges across the existing social and emotional skill curricula from an HCI perspective, tying these to potential technology support and mapping out the design space for HCI. This specifically builds on the detailed description of the approaches and strategies used to teach skills in SEL in education provided in Section~\ref{sec:SEL}, linking them to particular examples of, and opportunities for, HCI research. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.

%\todo{Wolfgang's start of putting this section into free text.} HCI dealt with many related aspects already, building growing evidence that HCI can help in addressing some of the key challenges in teaching and supporting social skills. Still, support for teaching social and emotional skills was not addressed in a systematic way so far. There are several examples where HCI research aims directly at teaching (or influencing) social skills. Most examples are from the autism domain, where a number of studies on using technology to help autistic children learn particular life skills (often social skills) exist. In the recent special issue on autism in Personal and Ubiquitous Computing journal, Hayes et al. \cite{Hayes2012} point out the potential of novel computing technologies, including assistive technologies, social systems and sensing and context aware systems for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Porayska-Pomsta et al. \cite{Porayska-Pomsta2011} argue for the importance of interdisciplinarity, and also highlight the methodological challenges that delivering effective socio-cognitive intervention by means of technology presents. The methodological issues are also pointed out by Zarin et al. \cite{Zarin2011} who presented a table top interface aimed at strengthening the communication and social skills of children with ASD and down syndrome. Escobedo et al. \cite{Escobedo2012} conducted a field test of this kind of intervention and deployed a mobile augmented reality system based on a successful social skills curriculum in a school setting with autism and neurotypical students. The application was able to improve the quality and quantity of social interactions among students by facilitating the practise of social skills in real life situations.

% {{{ Methodology
\subsection{Literature review methodology}      
\label{sec:methodology}
A large number of systematic reviews of SEL literature already exist, mainly with the focus on meta-analyses of measurable effects and long-term impacts of the curricula (e.g., \cite{Durlak2011,Weare2011,Adi2009a,Greenberg2010,Elbertson2009,Payton2008}).
%
We build on these and approach the topic with a complementary HCI perspective in mind, aiming to draw out processes, methods and topics commonly used within curricula, and identify the challenges the curricula designers currently face. 

As such, we analysed \Geraldine{G: need to say more about HOW\ this analysis was done eg by creating summaries of programs, then collating comparative overviews of these in what (?) and then mindmaps to draw out related topics, methods etc .. from this identified common topics etc etc }the contents of selected curricula, in addition to following references cited by the academic reviews above. Given the large number of available curricula, we based our review on a set of curricula selected by 'Collaboratory for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning' (CASEL)\footnote{\url{http://casel.org/}}, which is a non-profit organisation supporting research and application of social and emotional learning in education, co-founded by the leading figures in the academic field. 

In particular, we drew on curricula identified in two CASEL 'guides': \citeN{CASEL2003} guide reviews 80 SEL programs selected by a rigorous procedure, highlighting 22 of
% P: the first footnote speaks about the programs in general, the second about those that have been highlighted. But I agree it is confusing and should be combined together
 these as particularly well-designed. Each of the 80 programs is described, rated on 15 aspects and linked to academic literature evaluating its effects. The newer version of the guide, \citeN{CASEL2013}, focusses primarily on preschool and elementary school programs, recommending 23 programs.
%\footnote{Out of these, 14 have been already included in the 2003 version, and 9 are new: 4Rs, Competent Kids, Incredible years, MindUP, OpenCircle, Raising healthy children, RULER, Too Good For Violence, and Tools of the Mind.}. 
%
We first systematically analysed the descriptions of all programs in both guides, and continued with more detailed examination of the programs highlighted in either version of the guide (i.e., 34 programs altogether\footnote{Eleven programs selected in CASEL 2013 guide were already selected in the 2003 edition, leaving twelve newly described ones, leading to 34 programs altogether (22+12). \textbf{LIST\ THESE\ BY\ NAME\ HERE\ AS\ COMPLETE\ LIST?}}), as well as the academic literature available for each of these programs as referenced in the guides, as long as it was accessible through the libraries of three major universities (yielding 66 academic articles altogether). We also included any available course materials and descriptions of the programs that were available on the internet.

% {{{ SEL for schools
\subsection{Social and emotional learning for schools}
\label{sec:reasons}
%We chose social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools as an examplary domain we review in detail and return to other domains in the next section. %which serves as the basis for a \rephrase{system} of goals, methods and building blocks that encompasses also other domains.
%We outline the reasons for this choice below: 
Social and emotional learning in education is a particularly interesting domain for several reasons, all suggesting that the field can be considered relatively mature, with a number of well-researched and evidence-based approaches.
 

First, skills taught in school-based curricula are those that have been identified by psychologists and educators as crucial not only to development in childhood and teenage years, but more importantly as key skills for adult life \cite{Greenberg2010}. They also focus on a large span of ages, from kindergarten to university education. As such, it to some extent encompasses the goals of other life skills domains that tend to emphasise particular subsets of social skills, and consider many others to be already developed and available. % as shown in sections below.

Second, SEL has more than 20 years' history of peer-reviewed, evidence based programs. These have been already deployed to hundreds of thousands pupils. For example, \citeN{Durlak2011} reviews 213 programs encompassing more than 270000 students of all ages, with the interventions conducted over several years and federal programs support further uptake of such curricula in the US. Some studies have their effects tracked for even longer periods of time, as is the case for \citeN{Muennig2009} who have recently presented a 37-year follow-up study on the results of a randomized controlled trial conducted in 1962.  

Third, recent academic reviews analyse the evidence-base for the effectiveness of SEL programs and find measurable and significant positive effects \Geraldine{G: need to provide more detailed evidence of some of the main effects?  } of SEL in randomised trials for improving academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Weare2011} as well as positively impacting many other problematic aspects of behaviour such as mental health promotion \cite{Adi et al 2007a}, violence prevention \cite{Mytton2002,Adi2007b} conflict resolution \cite{Garrard and Lipsey, 2007} and bullying \cite{Vreeman and Carroll, 2007}.
%
%Lastly, the topic also gains increasing political support in the US and Europe, suggesting that social and emotional learning programs for schools might be soon \rephrase{common}. As such, SEL itself provides a novel design space for HCI that could have a strong impact on everyday life and direct real-world applications. 

 %Example of this might be the emphasis on communication skills in medical domains or workplace.

\subsection{Current status of SEL curricula in schools}

There is growing evidence that social and emotional skills are key to healthy development \cite{Weare2011,Adi2009a,Damon2006} as well as are connected to academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Caprara2000}. Unfortunately, many kids and young adults lack key social and emotional skills \cite{Foster2005},  %BlumLibbey-Durlak2011,
but the positive results highlighted below slow that it is also possible to teach these.
%
A number of curricula teaching such social and emotional skills are (commercially) available (see e.g., \cite{CASEL2003,CASEL2013} for a list of more than 75 selected curricula). Many are already deployed in schools, mainly in the US, e.g.,  \citeN{Foster2005} reports in a recent review of U.S. school practices that 59\% of schools already have in place some SEL curricula. %programs to address the development and support of childrens social and emotional competencies.


Several recent academic reviews map the evidence showing positive effects of SEL in randomised trials in improving academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Weare2011}. %For example, Durlak et.~al.~ \cite{Durlak2011} calculated that the effect sizes from the more than 200 SEL programs interventions averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests, 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills, as well as 10\% decrease in classroom misbehaviour, with the effects lasting for at least 6 months after the intervention.
%
         Teaching social and emotional skills has been also shown to impact many other on problematic aspects of behaviour such as mental health promotion \cite{Adi et al 2007a}, violence prevention \cite{Mytton 2002,Adi2007b} conflict resolution \cite{Garrard and Lipsey, 2007} and bullying \cite{Vreeman and Carroll, 2007}.

\subsection{Methods for teaching SEL in education -- procedural learning}
\label{sec:methods}
 
Social and emotional skills are highly complex abilities, strongly dependent on external inputs and context, and are often based on subconscious processing \cite{Ambady2010,Lieberman2000}. As such, social and emotional skills are mostly based on \emph{procedural} rather than declarative knowledge \cite[p.288]{kruglanski2007social}, which is acknowledged by all curricula. In other words, although people often have intuitive knowledge on how to react in social situations, it is problematic to explicitly articulate the processing rules by which they came to these conclusions. Examples of similar dependency on procedural skills can readily be found  in other aspects of our life such as language use, where we know which form in our native language is correct but not necessarily why (``it sounds better''); or in social cognition where people are, for example,  very sensitive to correct proportions of human face, but are not able to explicitly articulate even the most basic ones correctly \cite{Lewicki1987}. 

Moreover, the key ability of most social and emotional skills is to be able to react accordingly even within `hot' moments, i.e., despite being overwhelmed with emotions, or with the importance of the situation, or just having a very short time to react. During such moments, the ability of conscious, analytical thought is often diminished \cite{Wyman2010, leDoux1998}, again emphasising the need for learning skills on a procedural basis.  Such strong emphasis on procedural learning is also one of the main differences of teaching social and emotional skills to other aspects of education, which gives more emphasis on declarative learning. \textbf{This is  the reason why most of the existing HCI work on computer supported learning, looking to support these aspects, is out of the scope of this paper. \Geraldine{G: make this a footnote as breaks flow?}}

%The key focus on procedural learning is highlighted also by the methods used for % importance of \emph{procedural} (instead of declarative)
%teaching for social skills courses. 
%In particular, we identified several general methods and approaches used across virtually all curricula.

The methods used to teach social and emotional skills reflect this emphasis on procedural learning. Curricula include extensive examples and opportunities for personal experience and practice, combined with extensive feedback on behaviour and progress. Curricula attempt to break the skills down into `digestable' bits, focusing first on simple model situations and exploring these by role play, and only then slowly building up to more complex situations. These situations are then preferably drawn from real-world issues the students commonly experience, or particular experiences of the class. Repeated practice and extensive feedback from the trainer and peers are critical components in every step of the process.%  or linked to a book, personal narative etc. 

Once a skill is mastered within the lessons, the key emphasis is then on its \emph{transfer} out of the classroom into everyday contexts. Based on our reading of the literature, we argue that such transfer is something existing curricula struggle with most at the moment. Current approaches aim to support opportunities for the learners to practice their new skills  in real life situations outside of the classroom, but do not have many strategies to do so. Among the commonly used methods are: activities to increase awareness and remind learners about their skills on the school grounds (e.g., posters around the school); attempts to enlist the help of their social networks outside of the learning environment (e.g., letters to parents asking them to help reinforce the learning at home); as well as various home exercises for students. %As outlined in more detail in section~\ref{sec:HCIsupport}, this is one of the core aspects where HCI could contribute.
        
In summary, the curricula focus on procedural learning and aim to help children and teenagers to make the skills and concepts tangible, understandable, and support personal experience whenever possible. As such, emphasis is on repeated practice with feedback in the facilitated learning context, often through role play, and on transferring the learnt skills into the everyday situations, outside of the classical training context. The next section gives specific examples of using these methods and describes in more detail the topics taught.

% {{{ Topics in SEL
\subsection{Topics taught in SEL}
\label{sec:blocks}

Whereas the previous section focussed on methods and the general approaches taken to teach social and emotional skills (i.e., "how"), this section focuses on the content, i.e., "what" gets taught. %We aim to outline the commonalities among curricula in terms of the topics taught, the exercices/approaches to do so, and the order in which the topics are learned. % Similarly to above, we draw on thorough perusal of literature describing the twenty-three interventions selected as effective by \citeN{CASEL2013}; as well as other related literature.
%
To draw out the commonalities among curricula, we identified four overarching topics that appear in most of the courses we reviewed. These are:  
% most or almost all? But not 'that appear consistently in most' - contradiction as 'consistently' implies all???
\begin{enumerate}
        \item identifying and understanding emotions (own and of others);
        \item managing own emotions;
        \item developing communication and relationship skills;
        \item dealing with conflicts and problematic situations.
\end{enumerate}
 % Once mastered, these skills feed into the core competencies described in previous section, as shown at Figure~\ref{fig:strmap}.       

Each topic subsumes a number of simple situations or goals (e.g., being able to identify when becoming angry) and ways to train these (e.g., training learners to notice physical changes in their bodies). 
Although the exact approach, terminology or exercises used by a particular curriculum can differ from others, there is substantial similarity in the focus and emphasis on these sets of skills across the literature.
Moreover, these topics partially build on each other in a sequential manner. For example, the ability to identify and understand emotions is a key pre-requisite for managing own emotions (without knowing own emotions, one cannot control them), which is in turn needed for keeping relationships (appreciating the perspective of another, not jumping to conclusions) etc. As such, they are mostly taught in the order as shown at Figure~\ref{fig:depfoc}. 

We  describe each topic in more detail in a respective subsection below, illustrating the descriptions with examples of specific activities from selected curricula. Our goal is twofold: to provide an initial 'feel' for how such skills are taught in this domain; and to set up explicit examples that can be used in later sections to tie some of the existing HCI research to the approached presented here. 

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}


%\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\cdot$}
\subsubsection{Identifying and understanding emotions} 
        %\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}%

  %\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}%
The ability to identify and understand own and others' emotions is a prerequisite of most other social and emotional skills. A key goal is developing the emotional awareness of learners, which is the ability to differentiate, name and notice subtle changes of emotions. Curricula \Geraldine{G: all the other subsections list the relevant curricula at the beginning of the section so maybe move the footnote with the list from end of section to here}aim to train a practice of internal reflection, leading to continuous exploration of how we and others feel. Emphasis is also placed on making the distinction between acknowledging a feeling, and acting upon that feeling/urge. 

In particular, some of the curricula build on language usage, and especially on how use of language affects our thinking processes. Various exercises focus on developing the ability to identify emotions in both oneself and others, helping learners to become more reflexive and self-aware. As an example, the PATHS curriculum  includes physical ``Feeling Faces'' cards, which the child learners use to signal their current emotional state throughout the day \cite{Kam2004,Domitrovich2007}. Similarly,  RULER curriculum uses popular stories to exemplify particular emotions, or draw out distinctions among subtle variants of a specific one \cite{Reyes2012}. 
%
Another approach aims to support self-reflection by exploring and understanding how our bodies are affected by experiencing particular emotions. For example, children are helped to recognize their own feelings by checking their bodies and faces for `tight' or relaxed muscles, frowns, smiles, and sensations in other parts of their bodies such as butterflies in their stomachs. Matching the facial expressions and body postures shown on cue cards helps the children to recognize the cues from their own bodies and associate a word with these feelings \cite{Webster-Stratton2004}. 
%               
Emotions of others are explored through the ways in which they affect the tone of voice, body language etc. This is often incorporated as a game, e.g., developing the 'detective skills' to find out how others feel.  \textbf{Constant} \Geraldine{G: do you really mean constant ie no break??? }use of similar activities aims to help learners think more often about how they, and others, might feel in various situations. 

Curricula including content on identifying and understanding emotions are listed in the footnote\footnote{Caring School Community, I can problem solve, Life Skills Training, PATHS, Peace Works, Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, 4Rs, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, Michigan Model for Health, MindUP, RULER, Social decision making, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 21 in total}}.


\subsubsection{Self-control strategies}
        %\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}%
  %\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}%
Self control and management of own emotions is a key aspect present in all curricula\footnote{Life Skills Training, Lion's Quest, PATHS, Peace Works, Productive Conflict Resolution Program , Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RCCP, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, Teenage Health teaching Modules, 4Rs, Al's Pals, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, MindUP, Positive Action, RULER, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 24 in total}} and the techniques used to developed self control build on emotional awareness.%, aiming to teach strategies for managing strong emotions once they are recognised. 

Various strategies and exercises aim to help participants to relax and/or calm down once a strong feeling is recognised. These are often based on various physiological exercises such as muscle stretching and deep breathing techniques, or verbal labelling. Verbal labelling builds on psychology and neuroscience findings showing that the act of consciously labelling an emotion by name (rather than ``just'' being aware of it) facilitates higher cognitive control over the emotional state \cite{Greenberg2006,Reyes2012}. Exercises training explicit acknowledgement of emotions, as well as thinking about what could be their cause, are often used. 
Specific strategies for anger management are particularly common, often combining both verbal labelling and physical relaxation exercises. An example is the ``Turtle technique'' \cite{Robin1976}, which is still used in a number of curricula \Geraldine{G: footnote with these named?}. In this technique, children are taught to ``withdraw into their shell'' (by pulling their arms and legs close their body and closing their eyes) at specified occasions such as when they feel increasingly angry. This is followed by a relaxation phase, where specific muscle groups are tensed and released. Once this technique is mastered, children discuss and appropriate alternative strategies of dealing with stressful situations, now that they are able to consciously reflect and react to them.

\subsubsection{Communication skills}%Facilitating positive relationships},
                Another set of activities focuses on building good communication skills and supporting positive interactions with others\footnote{While implicit in many others, this aspect is explicitly highlighted within the following curricula: Michigan Model for Comprehensive Scholl health Education, Peace \textbackslash GeraldineWorks, Open Circle, RCCP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Tribes, Al's Pals, The Incredible Years Series, MindUP, Positive Action, Steps to respect curricula. {\bf 13 in total.}}. The skills taught here aim at supporting respectful empathic communication and thus implicitly facilitating friendship relationships, and an ability to collaborate and avoid conflicts that could otherwise occur through misunderstanding. 

                 The emphasis is on teaching active listening, which is then used to facilitate teaching empathy. Other teaching strategies also focus on training of specific communication skills (e.g., giving and accepting compliments).
                Exercises can include games to: induce collaborative activities; practise active listening, e.g., through listening to someone telling a story and then trying to rephrase it with as many details as possible; and disagree respectfully. These can include ways to subtly reframe a message into a form which is not threatening, such as in \citeN{ABER1998} where students are taught to acknowledge the potential mismatch between their and the other's perception of the situation (e.g., preferably saying "It seems to me you are not listening now.", rather than ``Why aren't you listening to me!'').

        \subsubsection{Dealing with conflicts and problematic situations} 
                Problem solving strategies and conflict management are the final topics of most curricula\footnote{Michigan Model for Comprehensive Scholl health Education, PATHS, Peace Works, Productive Conflict Resolution Program, Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RCCP, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, Tribes, 4Rs, Al's Pals, I Can Problem Solve, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, Positive Action, Social decision making, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 22 in total}}.  Violence prevention is commonly an important additional goal, as many of these curricula are designed  for schools and neighbourhoods with a high prevalence of aggression and weapon use. 
                
                
                Students are often taught a particular structure of reacting to a problematic situation or a conflict.
%
A key approach is to help students process the situation on a cognitive level, despite the fact that conflicts tend to ignite strong emotions. For example, the PATHS curriculum includes a ``semaphore'', where the sequence of red-yellow-green indicates a "stop-think-proceed" process \cite{Kam2004,Domitrovich2007}. Such structured sequences always include and emphasise a goal setting and evaluation phase. Moreover, curricula aim to teach children and teenagers to recognise which conflicts might have arisen from misunderstanding, with perspective taking exercises forming the core approach. An example are workshops focusing on win-win negotiation (e.g., in RCCP) and providing suggested sequences for steps to take during disagreements (e.g., in Incredible Years).

% {{{ Summary of SEL for education
\subsection{Summary of SEL in education}
There are several reasons to explore the social and emotional learning curricula in detail. SEL in education has a long history of research and a high number of evidence-based curricula, described in academic literature; it focuses on a large span of ages and foundational life skills; and  rigorous studies exist that evaluate the impacts over time and show strong positive effects \Geraldine{G: need more explicit data eg in 2.2 to really support this statement}. 
% curricula is plural ... it?
         We outlined the methods used to teach social and emotional skills. These are mainly based on procedural learning, involving focus on practice, need for feedback, and strong emphasis on supporting transfer of learnt skills into the real-world.
%
        We also described the content of the curricula in some detail. The discussion was structured according to the four overarching topics we identified on the basis of the literature review, with each topic comprising key sets of strategies and tasks used across the curricula. This provides specific examples of how the content of the curricula looks, and will allow us to tie it in with the challenges and opportunities for HCI in later sections.



%Although the specific strategies and exercises used to train skills do not transfer to other domains (e.g., "using detective skills to focus on emotions of others"), the focus on the four broad topics, and more importantly the general methodology approach is similar also to other domains, as the next section shows. 

%We also argue that due to these properties, it can provide an initial structure to encompass social and emotional skills training approaches also in other domains.  
        %very little literature on SEL for education exists in HCI, despite its high potential.
%

\label{sec:linkDomains}
Social
and emotional skills have also been identified as key skills in a number of other domains such as in business and medical settings, talk-based therapies and everyday settings. The core underlying SEL skill sets needed in these domains are very similar to SEL in education skills, and the domains indeed assume some foundational life skills were acquired through the education process; as such each of these domains focusses on a particular sub-set of skills in a more specialised and deeper way in their SEL programs. %, highlighting particular sets of skills that are most relevant to that domain. 
%while downplaying others (or assumes the learners already mastered them).

% {{{ Workplace and business related
\subsection{Workplace and business related setting}

A focus on emotional and social skills teaching has a long history in the workplace, e.g.,  \cite{Bailey1983,Bailey1983a}, appearing under a wide range of labels such as interpersonal skills, soft-skills or, more recently, emotional intelligence and developmental workplace coaching. Social and emotional skills training is included as part of professional educational programmes such as for MBA and undergraduate business students; it is also offered as part on ongoing professional development in the workplace, e.g., many companies offer soft-skills courses or coaching to their executives and increasingly also other staff. 
%
Academic literature shows positive effects of such training \textbf{(SUCH\ AS???)}, but the existing evidence is not as strong as for SEL in education. Some of the reasons are that training programs have often been developed on a purely commercial basis and outside of the academic community  and detailed information about the content of the programs is often not available for intellectual property and/or competitive advantage reasons \cite{Walter2011,Clarke2006,Riggio2003}. 




\subsubsection*{Methods} The majority of courses follows similar strategies: role-play as a key approach to teaching the skills, together with discussion of fictional and real life cases, demonstrations and modeling. Emphasis is again placed on procedural learning and the opportunity to practice and embed skills so that they become automated. Time-frames differ from a few hours to multi-day courses, and to longer-term learning relationships (e.g., as in coaching). 

\subsubsection*{Topics} 
        A key focus is on developing aspects of emotional intelligence (EI), which can be defined as ``the ability to carry out accurate reasoning focused on emotions and the ability to use emotions and emotional knowledge to enhance thought'' \cite{Mayer2008}. Such training might, for example, develop communication and cooperation skills, as well as increase self-awareness of the employees. 
        
        Specific leadership programs focussing on SEL skills in the workplace designed for executives are often aimed at relationship skills (such as conflict management and interviewing) and self-management (e.g., dealing with stress or time-planning and goal setting). Executives are often expected not only to learn these skills themselves, but also to be able to teach them to others later on. Coaching is often used as a way to help executives develop EI skills \cite{Bono2009}. It is inherently client-focussed, with the goals agreed depending on the situation, and emphasises accountability to the coaching relationship, honest feedback, supported reflection and accepting responsibility for own decisions. 

\textbf{(Not just for executives though in the workplace - this can sound like it is only for execs?)
}
\subsubsection*{Reviews}  \citeN{ArthurWinfred2003} provides a general overview of effectiveness of training within organisations, including training of interpersonal skills, and discusses the effects of various training designs. Their meta analysis reveals medium to large positive effect sizes  ($d$ around $0.60$) for organisational training courses. \citeN{Mayer2008} gives a thorough review of the 'emotional intelligence' concept, including connections between emotional intelligence and better real-world performance.   \citeN{Feldman2005} and \citeN{Bono2009} summarise the practices and processes used in executive coaching by practitioners, and \citeN{Carey2011} provides a rigorous review of academic literature on work-place based \textbf{(??? seeing you also mention coaching under the personal area???) }coaching.

% {{{ Medical settings
\subsection{Medical settings}
\GeraldineFIX{ G: need to think about this TITLE bit more - is this meant to be medical as in just doctors, or medical in its broader sense? Eg doctors, nurses, allied health, therapists, etc ... in which case 'clinical settings' might be a more encompassing term.... }
\GeraldineFIX{ G: then in writing up. you can say you focus first on the medical profession ... and do the doctor-patient training .... and then look at other healthcare/clinical professions more generally eg including nurses, physios, counsellers/therapists etc???}
\GeraldineFIX{ G: Also think the section structure could be thought about a bit more ... eg is it useful to separate out different SEL foci:... \\

gathering information from patient (interview/question skills???); giving difficult news;  establishing collaboratively designed care plans, empowering patients to take own responsibility etc ... there is a term for this model fo care but can't remember! (eg as in motivational interviewing)}

Social skills, such as communication skills or empathy, are increasingly recognised as core clinical skills in the medical community \cite{Rider2006,Barth2011,Makoul2007,Kalet2004}. Improvements in such skills have been shown to enhance patient satisfaction, adherence to therapy, and willingness to divulge sensitive information that may assist diagnosis as well as reduce the risk of subsequent litigations \cite{Stewart1995,Brown2008}. %As Brown \cite{Brown2008} puts it,  ``Over the last 20 years, the topic has raised from its status as a "nice to know" subject to that of a "need to know" skill set in modern medical education''. 
Most curricula focus on one of the three areas: (i) training of students during university courses; (ii) general courses and support for practicing medical personnel; and (iii) focus on specialised groups of medical personnel, such as cancer care or end-of-life care, where specific skills related to empathy and communication are even more important (e.g., when giving bad news to patient). Most of the courses are available for doctors, followed closely by courses for nurses. Peer-reviewed evidence of effectivity is available for many of the interventions in this domain, see reviews below.
% also physios (who do a lot of motivational interviewing to help people develop rehab programs they can stick with etc)
% reference Yedidia2003 -- intervention for students 

\subsubsection*{Methods} Role play with peers or trained actors is emphasised \cite{Stepien2006,Stiefel2010,Kalet2004,Barth2011}, followed by facilitator or peer based feedback \cite{Rao2007}. Courses also include workshops, lectures, discussions of case studies. Many courses that aim at general communication skills include scripted exchanges or examples to practise on. 

\subsubsection*{Topics} 
                Curricula focus both on self-oriented emotional skills for medical personnel as well as a wide range of interpersonal interaction skills. Courses on self-oriented emotional skills include aspects such as personal reflection, self-awareness mindfulness, or stress management training \cite{Shapiro2000,Epstein1999,Satterfield2007}. 
%
        Courses on interpersonal skills aim to support generic patient-clinician interaction. The emphasis is on the ability to inquire for diagnosis related information and clear communication of the results or suggestions (e.g., \cite{Kalet2004,Barth2011} for examples and review); as well as on other techniques such as  motivational interviewing \cite{Hettema2005},  aiming to empower the clients to take responsibility for own behaviours and decisions.  
%
        Empathy is understood as another a crucial component of successful and caring interactions between the patient doctors or nurses. Empathy is particularly important in interactions communicating deeply emotional and life-changing information, e.g., in oncology, but to a lesser extent also other general practice \cite{Barth2011}.
                For example, doctors often tend to ignore patients' emotions during difficult moments (e.g., having to communicate a critical diagnosis) and concentrate on the pragmatics, leading to negative consequences to treatment adherence and psychological functioning of patients. The training involves aspects such as sensitive responding to emotions from patients and improved understanding of patients’ psychosocial issues, concerns and needs as well as methods to do so while protecting emotional well-being of the clinician or nurse. Initial studies on including technology into the teaching process have been successful, e.g., \citeN{Tulsky2011} shows the benefits of combining lectures with tailored video-recording from doctors' own interactions.
\GeraldineFIX{ G: say what technology how used in a sentence???}
\GeraldineFIX{ G: this doesn't seem to be empathy but about self awareness/regulation?  ... P: Is this a bit better? 
I'm drawing on the reviews and the concerns they use in this space -- in my reading it is also around objectification of the patient etc... where regulation is obviously important, but also as a part of being able to emphasise in these cases without burn-out etc. ..

Emotional skills training for medical students is reviewed by \cite{Satterfield2007} and shows positive effects of the interventions. \citeN{Pedersen2009} and \citeN{Stepien2006} review training courses that specifically aim to increase empathetic skills of students or practitioners.

% {{{ Therapy 
\subsection{Talk-based mental health-care}
A crucial part of talk-based therapy aims to support the development of social and life skills, often for clients  disadvantaged by cognitive or emotional deficits or going through a difficult life situations at the time. % mainly for clients  with cognitive or other deficits.
%
The literature in this domain focuses on two main aspects. First is the therapy itself, i.e., strategies to support learning and improvement on the part of the clients. This aspect has already generated considerable research within HCI,  looking at using technology to extend and improve the therapy process. The existing work has focused so far mostly on autism related systems (e.g., \cite{Escobedo2012,Picard2009,Hayes2011,Porayska-Pomsta2011}), and cognitive-behavioural therapies (e.g., \cite{Coyle2011,Matthews2011}). The second aspect of talk-based therapies concerns the training and development of skills needed by the therapists/counsellors themselves, with the emphasis of supporting the learning process for the trainees leading to sofisticated combinations of class based learning and practice with real clients (under supervision of an experienced therapist). 



\subsubsection*{Methods}  
The methods used to work with clients during the therapeutic process differ depending on the psychotherapy approach chosen by the therapist. These can range from very specific training situation and exercises such as exposure therapy in Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT), to unstructured exploration of personal experience in humanistic approaches.  See, e.g., \citeN{Coyle2007} for a succinct review of the most common therapy schools and links to further resources. 

Skills development for students and novice therapists builds on a mix of lectures on the theoretical background and putting these into practice. This is done initially with peer students who role-play clients or share and discuss their (real) problems; but later in the learning process also with real-clients, where the students lead the therapy under close supervision of an experienced therapist. The emphasis on supervision is high, with majority of schools requiring student therapists to enroll into a therapy themselves while studying. 


\subsubsection*{Topics} 
In terms of supporting the therapy process or the client directly, the topics again differ substantially depending on the clients' issues or disorder, and personalisation is crucial. As such therapies can for example aim to help clients to achieve better self-awareness, support their self-control, decision making processes, or interpersonal skills; as well as help change deeply set negative thinking patterns.  %For a more specific example, clients with autism often have difficulties with basic social skills such as understanding emotional states of others or engaging/disengaging from interactions.  
% also examples from Coyle2011? -- depression, anxiety management
%\todo{add something on the effect of providing client feedback as a novel approach? }

Therapist training is most concerned with very detailed self-awareness on the part of the therapist, mastering the techniques and approaches of the studied psychotherapy approach. The ability to empathise and fully listen to the clients is emphasised as a key therapeutic skill. The aim of all these skills is to help develop a good working relationship with clients, which is seen as one of the main aspects of successful therapy \cite{Asay1999}.

\subsubsection*{Reviews}
         \citeN{Coyle2007} gives an excellent overview of use of technology in therapy, the potential for HCI involvement, and a good introduction to most common psychotherapy styles. 
        \citeN{Hill2006} reviews existing literature on teaching counselling and therapy students, showing significant positive effects of particular training methods. The book edited by \citeN{Duncan2010} provides a detailed review of the factors common across various therapeutic approaches, including large positive effect sizes of most therapies, and the key role of therapeutic relationship. %\citeN{Vismara2010} reviews another for empathy as key for therapeutic process (maybe something from Marci + can use the Heart of therapy book)

\subsection{Everyday life skills}
Everyday life skills courses comprise of a wide range of fragmented topics and methods. Due to this we will not keep to the same structure as in previous sections. Instead, we only briefly point to several illustratory examples where social and emotional skills are taught in, and for, everyday life settings; such as various life skills courses designed for a sub-clinical population. One such example are interventions supporting interpersonal skills (e.g., improving empathy for couples \cite{Long1999,Angera2006}, or \todo{parenting abilities? something else? ref}). Similarly, meditation, yoga, or more recently Mindfulness based stress reduction, all aim to support everyday self-awareness and improve personal well-being (e.g., \cite{Grossman2004,Marchand2012}).  %.  -- couldn't find any literature on courses that would not be for medically relevant population. My guess is that they exist (as per many such courses in the universities), but I have no reference to point to, yet. I also did not find an overarching review of mindfulness courses, closest available is \cite{Ludwig2008}. 
Moreover, commercially offered coaching and consultation services, as well as the wide usage of self-help books, point to ways of self-driven change of interpersonal or emotional regulation skills. Altogether, these examples draw out the large scope of everyday life skills learning, and the value people put into them; pointing to another area where potential for technology support is high.

\label{sec:summary} 

\iffalse
% {{{ Key competencies
In this section we identify what goals that are common across the domains. More importantly, we then characterise the challenges present within most of the curricula, with particular emphasis on those that could be supported by technology.

\subsection{Framework of life skill goals}

Despite the wide range of curricula and approaches within them, there are a overreaching goals that most interventions have in common. A set of \emph{five core composite competencies} is widely accepted within the educational community \cite{Zins2007,Durlak2011,CASEL2003,CASEL2013}, as such a list of general goals shared by most of the existing curricula. We suggest that this list can also serve well as an initial  of systematising the goals across all of the life skills training domains reviewed above. 
%
We list these compentencies as per \citeN{Durlak2011}:


%\todo{Not a good place for this? .. where does this go?}
%In other words, they provide a good description of the goal state (what SEL aims to achieve), and 
%
% serving as the key overreaching social and emotional skills that SEL curricula teach and promote. 
%
\begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Self awareness: }
                        The ability to accurately recognize one’s emotions and thoughts and their influence on behavior. This includes accurately assessing one’s strengths and limitations and possessing a well-grounded sense of confidence and optimism.
        \item {\bf Self-management: }
                         The ability to regulate one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations. This includes managing stress, controlling impulses, motivating oneself, and setting and working toward achieving personal and academic goals.
        \item {\bf Social awareness: }
                         The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures, to understand social and ethical norms for behavior, and to recognize family, school, and community resources and supports.
        \item {\bf Relationship skills: }
                        The ability to establish and maintain healthy and rewarding relationships with diverse individuals and groups. This includes communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating, resisting inappropriate social pressure, negotiating conflict constructively, and seeking and offering help when needed.
        \item {\bf Responsible decision making: }
                        The ability to make constructive and respectful choices about personal behavior and social interactions based on consideration of ethical standards, safety concerns, social norms, the realistic evaluation of consequences of various actions, and the well-being of self and others.
\end{itemize}
 
 Figure~\ref{fig:strmap} maps how the basic building blocks identified for the educational curricula contribute to learning skills included in the goals above. Similarly, Figure~\ref{fig:tableLinks} shows the differences in goal focus of the other domains. \todo{Need more detail about why this actually fits to the other domains as well?

These learning strategies are what I try to describe by the next section: in other words, they are sets of teaching approaches and simpler skills that are used commonly used by the curricula as a way to, eventually, reach the goal state.}

%While these composite competencies describe well the complex, interrelated set of skills that SEL programs aim to teach and support, it is however not immediately apparent \emph{how} such composite skills could be taught; and which parts might be open to technology support.

%We aim identify the most commonly used activities and program components that were appearing consistently across many of the curricula. We chose the categories with the HCI technology support in mind which allows us to highlight how particular classes of technologies map to these categories in section~\ref{sec:HCIsupport}.

\fi
In this section we start by identifying the common challenges curricula designers/teachers face across domains. This provides a structure to link social and emotional learning curricula with a broader HCI research agenda. 

Teaching methods and approaches are shared across all of the domains, linked together  by the joint focus on procedural learning and the common nature of the skills they teach. Based on our literature review, we draw out a set of four 'learning principles',  with each principle posing particular challenges to the curricula designers/teachers, as outlined in more detail below, and in the next section. The four principles are: 
%In particular, we consider four interrelated principles: 
\begin{enumerate}
        \item supporting feedback;
        \item facilitating practice;
        \item embedding and transferring of skills into everyday situations;
        \item supporting motivation and engagement of the learners.
\end{enumerate}



%(i) {\em supporting feedback} (ii) \emph{ facilitating practice}; (iii) \emph{embedding learning into everyday situations};  and (iv) \emph{supporting motivation and engagement} of the learners. 
%aims to identify the similarities across the domains in terms of topics, teaching process and challenges; and use these to point out the opportunities for technology-based support. 

We frame these principles with HCI research already in mind, chosing to distinguish them here in order to highlight particular issues one could consider supporting. In this sense, they provide a structure that helps to outline more clearly how the social and emotional learning could tie in with, and benefit from, HCI interests. We emphasise however that, although we find this set of principles useful to orient further discussion around the future research agenda, they should not be understood as independent, reified concepts. They are obviously interrelated and dependent on each other, and it is likely that any real-world system will draw on multiple if not all of these aspects; although perhaps focusing on some more than the others. We now provide a brief discussion of each of the four principles. 

%Figure~\ref{fig:sum-challenges} places all four principles into context: Feedback and practice play a central role in learning social and emotional skills, regardless whether within or outside of the learning contexts. Supporting transfer of learned skills by embedding parts of learning into everyday contexts and real-world situations is then one of the key goals in the training reviewed above. Additionally, learning experiences need to be engaging and motivating to be successful. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/challenges}
        \caption{Diagram of the identified learning  principles and their relationships}
        \label{fig:sum-challenges}
\end{figure}

%In particular, we draw out four learning principles:  %we draw out importance of practice, feedback, transfer and embedding of skills, and support for motivation and engagement as the four key principles: 
        \paragraph{Feedback}  As social and emotional skills are very complex and challenging for learners to track easily by themselves without external support, all curricula facilitate various ways to give the learners feedback on their behaviour. However, providing timely feedback is difficult even within the facilitated training sessions (and, without technology, next to impossible outside of them), especially as the expert trainer or peers serve as the key source of feedback. This leads to receiving feedback mainly in a post-hoc manner, often from unguided recollection of what was happening during the practice. Moreover, the trainer/students ratio commonly means that learners get feedback mostly from their peers, who are not trained or particularly skilled in what is taught. 

\GeraldineFIX{ G: make this clearer in discussion of strategies or process? "expert trainer or peers serve as the key source of feedback"; plus make clearer point earlier about the ratio of learners/teachers ... then this section has more context/base; \\ P: I added a bit into the methods section in SEL for education. I thought of including more details also into subsection 2.4, but it didn't fit (there isn't anything about practice etc -- all is about "what" rather than "how") }
\GeraldineFIX{ G: is it also useful to outline somewhere earlier or here what they are attending to give feedback on??? P:  I don't think there are any specific feedback categories that I'd know about (this wasn't outlined in detail in the reviews I read ). Maybe in some of the more detailed examples within SEL? But a quick read through didn't find any places where this could fit well ;/ }

\paragraph{Practice} Providing opportunities for practice is absolutely key for procedural learning. Support for personal experience and exploration of the skills is thus present across all of the reviewed domains and training approaches. Within the lessons, practice opportunities range from simple model examples that are role-played to trying to utilise situations that occur naturally within the classroom for opportunistic practice. It is however hard for current curricula to go beyond a short-term role-play, especially for topics that are ethically challenging such as responding to conflicts or emotionally loaded situations. And it is even more challenging to design ways to support learners in extending the (controlled) practice opportunities beyond of the immediate teaching interaction.
         
\paragraph{Embedding and transfer of skills} The ultimate goal of all social and emotional skills training programs is to transfer and embed the skills learned in the classroom into everyday behaviour and real-world situations. By embedding we mean transforming a skill that one can enact when prompted (e.g., in a practice session) into a skill which becomes an automated, nearly habitual response even in the everyday settings and situations.  
        %
        Curricula currently approach this on the one hand by including real-world examples and situations within the learning context (e.g., asking students to recall and discuss particular experience they had, or having doctors and therapists analyse data from their own practice), and on the other hand by attempting to extend the learning context also outside of the lessons. For example, curricula aim at increasing awareness (e.g., posters placed around the building), follow-up meetings to support recollection of what was learned, or asking learners' social network to help reinforce the learning and skills in between sessions.
        % 
        However, the current approaches are limited in scope and effectivity, and there is little curricula designers can do to directly influence embedding outside of the learning sessions. As such, this learning principle poses challenges that could perhaps most benefit from technology support. 

\paragraph{Motivation and engagement} Supporting motivation and engagement of the learners also plays a major role in all learning experiences. It is acknowledged as a key aspect within SEL for education, and increasingly also across all other domains and curricula. Existing work in HCI around creating engaging experiences suggests a potential to augment many aspects of the curricula, making them more engaging and thus motivating for the learners.
%Methods used strongly depend on the topic, target group of learners and outcomes the curricula aim to achieve. 

%Motivating learners is important throughout the social and emotional skills learning process and ranges from enhancing the in classroom experience to utilizing technology to enable engaging ways to practice skills and to foster the enduring use of the acquired skills throughout everyday life. 
\medskip

To summarise, figure~\ref{fig:sum-challenges} places all four principles into context: Feedback and practice play a central role in learning social and emotional skills, regardless whether within or outside of the learning contexts. Supporting transfer of learned skills by embedding parts of learning into everyday contexts and real-world situations is then one of the key goals in the training reviewed above. Additionally, learning experiences need to be engaging and motivating to be successful. 

The diagram also highlights the importance of the \emph{facilitated nature} of most social and emotional learning, pointing to a strong distinction between the directly facilitated learning processes available within the lessons and learning outside in the real-world situations. We also argue later, in section~\ref{sec:facilitated}, how this facilitated learning context poses an intriguing and valuable setting by itself -- it combines the benefits of a reasonably controlled setting (curricula with well defined structure; mostly inside a specific room; and facilitated by a SEL expert), but still allows for testing systems in real scenarios (i.e., the learning context). This could be especially interesting for initial deployment and exploration of the novel technologies in social and emotional learning space. 
\GeraldineFIX{ G: be clearer what you mean by learning affordances here?}




\iffalse 
% {{{ OLD - similarities 
\subsection*{Similarities in topics} Although the exact skills taught are specific to each domain, all share interest in supporting aspects of two broad categories of skills: 
\begin{enumerate}
        \item First are various aspects of {\bf emotional awareness}, including understanding and reflecting others' emotions as well as being aware and managing your own, dealing well with stress or controlling strong feelings. Examples can be the skills identified for SEL in education withing the first two topics, i.e., identifying emotions and self-control. Similarly, the core emotional intelligence exercises in business involve various facets emotional awareness, as do the personal reflection or stress management parts of medical courses. 
        \item Second category focusses on {\bf communication and relationship skills}, mostly building on emotional awareness. These can be the ability to emphasise, cooperate, take perspective and constructively deal with conflicting situations and hard decisions. In particular, the third and fourth topic identified for SEL are directly relevant, as is the emphasis on conflict management, leadership and interviewing in business settings, and patient interviewing or empathy training  in the medical domain. 
\end{enumerate} 

However, these categories are very broad and each domain is aiming to support slightly different aspects. It thus important to go deeper into the particular topics of the chosen domain to reach more detailed understanding of what aspects are emphasised, taught and how (similarly to what we attempted to outline for SEL in education).

\subsection*{Challenges for curricula designers}
%%%%%% rubbish starts :) %%%%
Curricula designers face several key challenges across the domains. These concern methods for providing (preferably real-time) feedback on learnt skills, ways of supporting learning experiences beyond the immediate scope of the facilitated training sessions.  

Providing timely feedback is difficult even within the facilitated training experience, especially as it is the trainer or peers who serve as the key source of feedback. This leads to receiving feedback in a post-hoc manner, mostly from unguided recollection of what was happening during the practice. Moreover, the trainer/students ratio often implies that learners get feedback mostly from their peers, who are not trained or particularly skilled in what is taught.  

It is even more challenging to design ways to support learners in extending the learning experiences beyond of the immediate teaching interactions, which is however key for sucessful transfer of skills into the real world. 

It is particularly difficult to instrument and support the practice of pupils outside of the learning lessons without technology in other ways than voluntary homework, or provide support to help learners embed the learnt skills into their everyday practices. Providing any feedback on behaviour outside of the teaching session is also problematic for the current curricula, leaving restrospective discussions based on recall as one of the few available options. 

By helping to address these challenges, HCI involvement could fundamentally augment and enhance the possibilities of existing courses, plausibly leading to novel and more effective learning and teaching methods. 

%While the courses across all domains have been shown to be effective, there are still challenges common to many of them. 

%One of the key ones is supporting and extending the learning experiences \emph{outside of the classroom}.  

%Moreover, we also see a high potential of technology to further support and augment existing teaching approaches within the classroom. We envision opportunities for support also for the remaining three teaching process principles described above, such as providing additional feedback opportunities (e.g., in real-time), environments and situations for practice (e.g., virtual reality or game environments), as well as helping to make the learning more engaging. The next section describes this in detail together with how doing so might also raise interesting novel questions and issues for HCI.

Although we do not attempt to provide a systematic review of all relevant HCI work, these examples suggest the extent of existing HCI work that could be re-appropriated as relevant to social and emotional learning; and they also highlight the opportunities and challenges this would pose to HCI research.

   %how making the connections explicit could be beneficial for both HCI as well as SEL.  

We use the four learning principles to orient and structure the discussion here, for several reasons. It provides a direct connection to the curricula structure and approaches, as identified earlier. Additionally, we believe that this differentiation into learning principles can serve as a good initial basis for future HCI work within this topic. Table \ref{fig:HCIsummary} outlines the connections between the learning principles and existing themes of research in HCI of each learning principle, as discussed in the rest of this section. We then further divide the discussion of each principle into exemplary areas open of technology support, for which relevant research exists in HCI already. %according to the existing strands of research within HCI.

% {{{ Feedback
\subsection{Feedback}
\label{sec:feedback}
Social and emotional skills are hard to track by the learners themselves during the learning process and all curricula incorporate various ways to give feedback on their progress. However, these are mostly based on trainers' or peer feedback, leading to a prevalently post-hoc, high-level feedback based on recollection. As such, there are explicit challenges and opportunities for facilitation of timely feedback both within and outside of learning sessions. Prior HCI research suggests that there is also a potential for novel kinds of feedback altogether, such as feedback based on physiological signals or other sensed data. Such feedback could be provided in real-time, and through many different modalities (wearable, haptic, ambient, on the group vs. individual level etc.). This could fundamentally augment and enhance existing curricula and learning processes. 
\GeraldineFIX{ G: re novel modes - take some time to spell out different possible modalities? P: I tried adding more detail, but I could not get the balance right and it always seemed to break the flow, or be incomprehensible (current version is probably incomprehensible:)}
%
%               As the teacher personally (or peers) are the only ways of providing feedback in the current curricula so far, additional feedback systems based on technology could be useful to help participants receive ``more'' feedback, either on a more micro level or just more often. Such additional feedback opportunities would be particularly useful outside of training sessions (when the trainer or mentor is no longer available), but also during the sessions when there is often only one instructor giving feedback to many students.
%
%       We now outline related HCI work and how it could be linked to these challenges.

%Moreover, we argue that the focus on feedback for social and emotional skills could be especially fruitful topic for HCI community, leading to novel research directions and focus.
\GeraldineFIX{ G: repeats and also very content free ... lose? or be more concrete?} 
In particular, HCI has only recently started to focus on tracking  aspects important for learning of social and emotional skills, such as the interest in emotion detection in affective computing, systems supporting awareness and personal reflection, or the initial work in social signals processing. It is likely that results of this on-going work could immediately augment existing curricula; but, in doing so, also raise intriguing challenges for HCI including many well-motivated, complex practical problems to tackle for the developing technology.

This subsection first reviews systems supporting \emph{personal reflection and awareness} (subsection \ref{sec:emaware}), and then discusses the initial work looking into supporting or affecting \emph{communication} (subsection \ref{sec:strategies}). 
Due to space concerns, we focus here mainly on work attempting to sense aspects of behaviour that could be used as the basis for feedback. This leaves out other important research exploring the modes in which feedback can be provided. We refer the reader to other reviews, such as \citeN{Borner2013} (ambient displays feedback in learning contexts), \todo{ambiguous vs. explicit feedback?  ... maybe one of the technical reviews on ubiquious computing re situated feedback? ... and also else [ref]}.

%The third subsection discusses the specific focus on following \emph{structured ways of reacting} to particular situations, which is prevalent in school and medical domains curricula \todo{ -- may move to practice section}. %In doing so, we point to examples of related HCI research which illustrate the potential synergy:
%       \begin{itemize}
%               \item emotional awareness (\ref{sec:emaware})
%               \item self-control  (\ref{sec:selfcontrol})
%               \item communication skills (\ref{sec:strategies})%, e.g., active listening, correct communication patterns, non-verbal behaviour 
%               \item structured ways of reacting, e.g., following a sequence of steps to deal with a conflict situation (\ref{sec:structure})
%       \end{itemize}

  

% {{{ Emotional awareness
        \subsubsection{Reflection and emotional awareness}~\\
        \label{sec:emaware}
Much work has been recently done in HCI around supporting reflection  (e.g., \cite{Fleck2010} \cite{editorial from special issue on reflection eg by Corinne Sas and others?}), recognising and tracking emotions and helping people reach better awareness about, and control over, their behaviours. Such systems would fit well into many aspects across all curricula, such as the exercises aimed to teach the learners to reflect on, and label, their emotions; emotional awareness exercises in business and medical social skills courses; as well as systems to support personal reflection in therapy. 
         
A part of this research is driven by advances in sensor technologies leading to affective computing systems and social signals processing in general (e.g., \cite{Sun2011,Pentland2008}), with the aim to automatically assess variables of interest such as conversational engagement or mimicry.  Other work looks at supporting personal reflection by providing users with additional data about their activities, and aims to support their own reflection rather than providing system-based interpretation (e.g., \cite{Kalnikaite2010,Hook2008,Slovak2012}). We give particular examples for both approaches below.

A number of papers focused on tracking and visualising emotional changes over longer periods of time, helping users to become more self-aware and draw out patterns that they wouldn't have noticed otherwise. This can be either on a more automatic, affective computing basis, as in AffectAura \cite{McDuff2012} and Mood Meter \cite{Hernandez2012}; or with more emphasis on the interpretation on the part of the user (e.g., Affective Diary \cite{Stahl2008,Sengers2007,Hook2008} or SenseCam \cite{Kalnikaite2010,Fleck2009} work). 
% 
Similarly, Subtle Stone \cite{Balaam2010} presents users with options to indicate their current emotion through an ambient, ambiguous visualisation, very closely resembling the Feeling Faces used in PATHS curriculum. The nature of the technology could however support more than ``just'' a moment-to-moment reflection tool, enhancing Feeling Faces by tracking and facilitating reflection over time, have the potential to aggregate class 'mood'  etc.; all of which might be useful additional opportunities for the curricula design. 
%
Initial research has also focused on more in-the-moment self-awareness. Examples are  systems such as designed by \citeN{Moraveji2011} to support greater awareness of own breathing and helping the user to maintain a calm and relaxed state; or mobile tracking systems exemplified by \citeN{Rabbi2011}. Such systems might be used either in a nearly unchanged form as a part of supporting breathing relaxation exercises taught across domains; or serve as inspiration for new systems aiming to reflect background awareness of other aspects trackable by technology. 
%
To summarise, these examples illustrated systems supporting users to reflect on their emotions and behaviour, but did not aim to help control or react to emotions or behaviours when these were recognised.
                %       \todo{Add some of the autism work? Argue that this could be somehow extended beyond the limited focus on simple skills within autism? But probably this is rubbish.}

%               \subsubsection{Self-control} 
%               \label{sec:selfcontrol}

Supporting self-control is a key component of many of the curricula across domains. Specific focus is often given on impulse management, such as anger or accute stress, where the pivotal aspect is realising that one is getting angry or stressed, %(or feels other strong emotion) 
        and then triggering the appropriate response, e.g., techniques for calming down. However, it is challenging to get feedback promptly when learning this. 
%       
        The recent advances within affective computing drawing on physiological signals could be particularly useful here. 
%       
        For example, \citeN{Bouchard2012} shows how a short training based on a combination of physiological signals feedback and a computer game as a stimulus can help soldiers better manage their stress in other situations, reporting significantly better results than traditional techniques. Similarly, there are recent results suggesting the possibility to automatically track seizures \cite{Poh2012}, arousal increase in autistics \cite{Picard2009}, or interruption detection \cite{Pan2011}, all outside of the lab and (close to) real-world settings. Additionally, much of the other social signals processing work bears promise to provide additional approaches to detecting key emotional states such as anger or stress with sufficient precision, building on audio and video analyses techniques \cite{Vinciarelli2012} that might be well suited for tracking  within the classroom/training room (or other enclosed spaces such as a meeting room). 
%
Such systems would fit well with the content many of the curricula across the domains, where the students are taught to observe and reflect on the changes felt in their bodies during (and at the beginning) of such episodes. Moreover, many of the sensors are wearable and are likely to become unobtrusive soon, suggesting the potential to support feedback outside of classroom and during everyday life. 
%
 Other aspects of managing own emotions focus on keeping up motivation, postponing pleasurable experiences etc., could perhaps also be facilitated by providing support for relevant personal reflection; or might even have measurable correlates detectable by sensors or analysis of logged data.

        Many curricula involve exercises to teach particular communication and interaction styles or strategies. Prior work in HCI suggests ways in which technology might support and enhance the feedback possibilities, with the potential to make the learning more effective. In particular, a number of papers show how relevant aspects of interaction are trackable in real-time, and how providing feedback on these can affect and change interaction in positive ways. These systems suggest that similar feedback could be useful for many aspects of the curricula, including active listening, constructive communication styles or perpective taking exercises.
        
        For example, the Meeting Mediator system by \citeN{Kim2008} directly feeds back speaking behaviour of participants in a discussion. Such feedback lowers domination of individuals and helps achieve a more balanced discussion.  Similarly, \citeN{Pentland2008} shows techniques to track aspects such as influence or activity within the interaction and \citeN{Gatica-Perez2009} reviews other methods to analyse and track aspects of social interaction in small groups. Moreover, \citeN{DiMicco2007} discusses how increased awareness of parts of the interaction can affect and shape group dynamics. 
        There are also indices that even subtler elements of interpersonal interaction can be addressed. For example, \citeN{Balaam2011} shows how feedback based on non-verbal behaviour can affect and increase feelings of rapport. Although \citeN{Balaam2011} used Wizard of Oz techniques to select the indicators, there are already several systems that aim to automise similar tracking \cite{Sun2011,Hagad2011}. Similarly, \citeN{Daily2010} uses physiological data to provide a posteriori feedback on group discussion in classes, supporting improved reflection of the shared experience and empathy. \citeN{Skinner2009} present a technology based course for medical doctors based on a lecture and a set of video clips demonstrating important aspects, tailored to each doctor by including relevant fragments of the doctor's own interactions with patients recorded earlier. A randomised control trial shows a significant improvement in doctors' empathy towards patients in contrast to a wait-listed control group \cite{Tulsky2011}.

% {{{ Practice
\subsection{Practice}

All the reviewed curricula aim to provide extensive opportunities to practice, mainly within the lessons, using role-plays and model situations as the key methods. The goal is to practice `proper' reactions and understanding of situations and challenges one can face in daily life. By practice we mean here a consciously accomplished activity with the goal to further develop the skill in question. 
        
Existing HCI literature points to two areas which are directly relevant. As receiving feedback on own behaviour is key for successful practice, the technology outlined in previous section can directly extend the opportunities for students' practice, especially outside of learning sessions where little or no feedback is otherwise available. Facilitating practice `in the wild' thus presents novel opportunities and challenges  for many applications of ubiquitous computing, such as wearable, mobile and sensor-based technologies. Secondly, recent work on
\GeraldineFIX{ G: 'ubiq' is too generic .. do you need to say eg using mobile, wearble, sensor-based or whatever ??? pint it down more specifically? tech bits are all a bit too glossed over perhaps?\\
P: Glossing over is a problem I know about -- my issue is that, as usual, it is hard for me to pick a few detailed aspects to highlight, when it feels that basically any technology you can think of has use in this settings (if you find a good place in a curricula so that it fits well etc...) Any tips appreciated :) }
 conversational/relational agents together with research on virtual spaces  points to novel, easily controllable and configurable environments would allow students to practice in a wide range of novel model situations, settings and topics. This would be especially for concepts that are problematic to tap into normally, either due to ethical concerns (e.g., dealing with a conflict situation) or infeasible to enact in class. We review the two areas below.  %Third, the rising interest in serious games could also bring opportunities for further practice of particular skills.

\subsubsection{Bringing practice opportunities "into the wild"}~\\ 
\GeraldineFIX{ G: use the language of 'into the wild' as a parallel type of situation to make links to current chi issues clearer... P: Not sure what this means?}
One of the key problems  existing curricula face when aiming to facilitate practice outside of the lessons is the difficulty in providing learners with sufficient and timely feedback or support during practice. This could be in form of real-time feedback during the external practice sessions, but also as a post-hoc support, helping the learner more reliably recall and reflect on own behaviour. 

Many of the feedback options described above have been, or at least have the potential, to be deployed in real-world use, suggesting that such systems could extend practice and feedback possibilities available to social and emotional learning outside of formal learning settings. 
%
For example, the systems supporting reflection have been mostly developed with real-world use in mind (\cite{McDuff2012,Balaam2011,Stahl2008,Moraveji2011}).  Initial work has also deployed analogous principles to support emotional awareness training \cite{Matthews2011} or social skills exercices tracking \cite{DeSa2010} for psychotherapy clients, drawing on the increasing power and ubiquity of mobile phones. 
%
Prior work also shows how technology can help shape and support practice, in particular interaction strategies outside of the class. For example, the MOSOCO project \cite{Escobedo2012,Tentori2010} exemplifies how mobile phones can help children on the autistic spectrum practice their social skills outside of lessons, and how the system can help elicit feedback from their peers. Such systems fit well with the emphasis on following pre-structured ways of reacting present in medical/education domains.

Feedback on other interactional aspects could be deployed in the wild. For example, systems such as Meeting Mediator \cite{Kim2008} or those described by \citeN{Pentland2008} could be easily adjusted to provide information on real-world meetings. Similarly, existing research suggests that some of the systems based on physiological signals could be also applicable outside of the laboratory or teaching contexts despite the increased noise such situations bring (e.g., \cite{Pan2011}). 
%
%\todo{Add pointers systems such as \cite{Tulsky2011}, which support post-hoc feedback on real-world practices, by recording and then annotating? In some way, it fits into reflection, but at the same time, it includes getting new feedback, e.g, from teacher or peers. The good thing is that is also comes from medical domain, i.e., not school education.}

We argue that developing technology to support feedback and practice in the wild would highly benefit existing social and emotional learning programs, regardless of the domain, as it clearly addresses one of the key issues such curricula face. It would, however, also bring crucial challenges to HCI research, requiring systems that are robust enough to cope with ``in the wild'' settings and specific issues around which aspects can be sensed at all, degree of adaptability, cost-benefit ratio etc. Section~\ref{sec:techAspect} discusses such technological challenges in more detail.   
\GeraldineFIX{ G: AND.... elaborate more eg specific types of challenges ... capture, process, represent etc? devices? implicit vs explicit? degree of control/tailorability/personalisability? does it get shared, privacy etc? etc etc}


\subsubsection{Novel environments for practice}

Curricula across all domains include a large number of role-play or modelling examples, allowing the learners to test and explore skills in a safe situation. Prior research suggests that technology could support novel settings, such as virtual environments or games, that can substantially extend and augment the potential for such role-play and practice.  


Initial work on 'serious' games suggests that these can address many complex concepts relevant to social and emotional learning, and do so in an engaging way. For example, \citeN{Coyle2011} shows how a specially designed game can enhance and positively augment cognitive behavioural therapy, especially for teenage patients. Similarly, prior research has looked at the possibilities of novel interfaces such as multi-touch tabletops to augment therapy with autistic children, including aspects of cooperation \cite{Piper2006} or communication skills \cite{Zarin2011}. Moreover, there is initial evidence that similar serious games could also help people from the non-clinical populations. For example, \citeN{Hailpern2011} designed a game that helps relatives and friends of patients with aphasia to increase awareness and understanding of the aphasia disorder, and how it must feel for the patients themselves; and \citeN{Rusch2012} aimed to facilitate a similar understanding of depression. Similarly, \citeN{Rubin-Vaughan2011} developed and deployed a curriculum consisting of a series of games that help children practice their social skills such as perspective taking, with a specific focus on bullying prevention exercises.  % Other work focusses on re-appropriating existing games for learning contexts.For example, \citeN{Bouchard2012} re-uses and enhances a modern game to provide an environment for stress management training of soldiers. Similarly, \citeN{Gonzalez-Gonzalez2012} discusses how specific use of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMOPRG) can foster learning of social skills. For a recent review of the impact of games on skills learning see \cite{Connolly2012}.
Altogether, this works suggests that serious games have the potential to augment the learning of complex social and emotional skills, including aspects such as perspective taking, empathy, active listening, and exploring impacts of one's choices.
\GeraldineFIX{ G: role play also ?  P: Didn't seem to fit here for me as role play is more of a method rather than a skill to be learned ... Also the leading para of this section argues for the use of games as they help support role-play. Maybe that is the place to emphasise this more?}

Augmented and virtual reality environments have been successfully used in similar contexts. For example, virtual reality is increasingly applied in therapy to help people control social phobias (e.g., \cite{Romano2005}), or reduce physical pain \cite{Gromala2011}. % with the immersion into the simulated situation . 
%
Moreover, an increasing number of papers draw on \citeN{Bailenson2008} and explore how changing aspects of interaction in virtual reality affects learning or behavioural change. For example, \citeN{Fox2009} suggests that amplifying feedback of user's actions (e.g., the character gets literally slimmer when exercising) can increase the persuasive impacts that transfer in the real-world (e.g., more exercise in the voluntary phase of the study); or that experiencing a ``superpower'' within virtual reality can lead to measurable increases in prosocial behaviour in the real-world \cite{Rosenberg2013}. 
%
Augmented reality environments have also been used in other educational settings, although mainly for cognitive rather than social or emotional skills learning, see \citeN{Wu2012} for a review.
%
Additionally, research on embodied agents presents initial work on using agents to support learning of particular skills, such as negotiation in \citeN{Core2006}. Much work also focusses on creating virtual agents that can elicit feelings of empathy, support and maintain relationships \cite{Bickmore2005,Bickmore2010}, often building on concepts such as mimicry or rapport. % ; including work showing how making the agent mirror user's own non-verbal behaviour can increase perceived liking and persuasiveness.} 
\GeraldineFIX{ G: Bickmore's work too? Picard work?? will need to be seem to referencing these labs/people -- P:done ... the Bickmore2005 is both Picard and Bickmore:) ... also Picard was referenced a lot (directly and indirectly) in the earlier affective computing section}
In summary, social and emotional learning curricula could especially benefit from VR or augmented reality systems given the potential to simulate situation that be difficult or impossible to stage in real-life; and perhaps even more so in combination with the gaming and embodied agents elements described above (as VR seems to intensify the immersion). 
%When "turned around" (e.g., emphasising your non-verbal gestures and body position by changes in an avatar you are interacting with) it is possible that these could be reappropriated for learning purposes.

% {{{ Embedding into every day  
\subsection{Embedding learned skills into everyday life} 
        Once a skill is partially learned, for example when the learner can enact it in a practice situation, the ultimate goal of the curricula is to support the learners in embedding such skills into their everyday behaviours and situations. In other words, embedding aims to support the transfer of skills learned in sessions into a skill that are increasingly generalised and ingrained into everyday situations. In this sense, there is a subtle but important difference between embedding (background support for on-going, natural, everyday situations, over longer periods) and practice (a consciously enacted, specific activity aimed at practicing of a particular skill).

Despite it's importance, there is little trainers (or curricula designers) can do to facilitate and support such embedding at the moment. %apart from in-sessions training (e.g., role-play with real-world examples or dealing with naturally arising situations), or attempts to increase awareness awareness of the learned concepts outside of the sessions by, e.g., posters, reminder emails and, in the case of SEL for education, letters to parents.
%
In the rest of this section, we outline two exemplary ways in which technology and existing HCI research might help address the challenge. First, a large body of research exists on using technology to facilitate behavioural change, supporting people in changing their everyday activities and habits. As social and emotional skills are also mostly behaviours (rather than, e.g., declarative 'knowledge'), many of the techniques introduced in HCI for health or sustainability behaviour change are likely to be relevant; although the specifics of social skills again have the potential to further challenge existing HCI systems into novel directions. Second aspect is using technology to transfer part of the expert/trainer role to other social contacts in participants' lives such as drawing on social support and feedback from their friends, colleagues, and parents (in the case of SEL in education); or support interactions with networks of strangers (who however share the same goals). 
%
Together, such use of technology has the potential to enhance and augment one of the greatest challenges of the existing social and emotional skills learning curricula. 


%\todo{The earlier text is just about social support. Now we want to start with making skills habitual etc. as per the text copied below from the intro:}

%\todo{Old text:} Throughout the social skills learning process, the provision of support  from parents and family during everyday life is key for many of the analysed curricula. This kind of social support can provide a potential way of integrating the learning into everyday life. However, such embedding in everyday life is, in some ways, the least developed aspect of the curricula, currently  mainly done by meeting with parents at the beginning/end of a course and by sending letters and asking school children to do homework. In this area, technology can be employed in two ways: One the one hand, to facilitate social support by utilizing situated systems which connect students with their family and peers; and on the other hand by using ambient and ubiquitous persuasion that can sense student's activities in context and give adequate and timely feedback also outside the classroom.

% {{{ Behav change
                \subsubsection{Behaviour change technologies}
Learning new social and emotional skills often includes a considerable change in habits and ways learners would automatically react and/or behave; and this is also one of the key reasons why procedural learning is emphasised across all curricula and domains. %Routines and habits as something to be changed -- similar to social skills where although motivation for change might be present, hard to change existing patterns. 
While techniques for procedural learning are well established and available in sessions, curricula currently have little options to support embedding of the skills already learnt in class into everyday patterns of behaviour of the learners.

        
Behavioural change research within HCI has dealt with similar challenges, mainly in the context of health or sustainability \cite{Hekler2013,Consolvo2009,Klasnja2011}. % Such systems are often based on helping participants increase/reduce particular activities (such as go running, or stop smoking), often by facilitating that neccesary behaviours become a part of users daily schedules (e.g., running at least 3 times a week, or not having more than 1 cigaret a week), thus shaping new habits.
Many behavioural change systems are based ambient technology used to tracking user behaviors in everyday life over extended time periods, helping to facilitate users' discovery of emerging patterns, enable exploration and monitor own progress. For example, electricity \cite{Gustafsson2005}, water \cite{Kuznetsov2010} or food \cite{Ganglbauer2013} was tracked and displayed to users in order to encourage conserving these resources.  Similarly, mobile devices and sensors were used to continuously track personal information such as physical activity data  \cite{Lin2006a,Consolvo2008a} to facilitate ongoing awareness and promote e.g. healthier habits; or domestic activities such as TV consumption and household chores \cite{Reitberger2013}, fostering reflection and renegotiation of such activities.
%
Such ambient systems support the user over an extended period of time by sensing relevant information and feeding it back in a contextually adequate way, going beyond conscious practice on an one-off basis and under specific circumstances. Systems can also provide on-going subtle cues for facilitating awareness or triggers that remind users to attend to intended activities \cite{Li2010,Consolvo2009,Obermair2008}. 

Although behaviour change literature directly addressing social skills is scarce in HCI so far, we expect that  similar strategies and technologies we see in other behavioural change topics could work well also for (parts of) SEL.
%despite clear differences in what types of activities are tracked or supported, and the technical difficulties for doing so  (e.g., social skills being harder to measure when compared to tracking the water consumed or distance ran).
Several examples of existing work provide preliminary evidence on how such long-term support and embedding might be possible. %, perhaps through higher reliance on the capabilities and reflection of the users.} 
%
One such example is SocialMirror \cite{Hong2012}, an ambient system to support everyday behaviours of independently living people with autism, allowing the users to ask and receive advice from a trusted community of acquaintances and professionals; and \citeN{Munson2010} integrated a well-known positive psychology intervention into a social networking site, meshing with users daily habits around these sites. 
Similarly, \citeN{Mamykina2008} designed MAHI, a system for newly diagnosed diabetes patients, extending the in-class lessons by facilitating participants' ability to track, reflect on and analyse their everyday experiences with diabetes, leading to improved feeling of control over the disease.


Altogether, the examples above suggest that many behavior change techniques have potential to foster the continuous application of learned skills throughout everyday life, and support learners in sustained and habitual use of these skills in the appropriate situations. %However, major challenges remain for HCI in this area, such as the robust sensing of social skills and interactions, adequate feedback modalities and finding the right duration and frequency for the deployment of the respective technologies.   
% }}}

% {{{ Social support
\subsubsection{Situated social support} 

        Curricula across the domains rely on the trainers or peers to support the learning process by providing feedback, emotional support or tracking progress. However, trainers' or peers' support is problematic to extend and maintain beyond the in-session learning in the current curricula.  This is particularly important for SEL in education, where parent involvement (and out-of-session peer presure) constitutes a major aspect.  %, across all curricula. and  despite the activities being. 
%       \item Although this is relevant to all curricula, it is  %As mentioned earlier, current curricula attempt to involve parents in, e.g., through asking them to come to meetings or sending them information sheets and letters, but this is not very effective. 
Prior work in HCI suggests ways of facilitating additional support and feedback for participants' also from their other social contacts, and outside of the learning sessions. 


                
For example, initial studies suggest ways by which the expert role of the trainer can be shared with or distributed to other social contacts, such as involving parents  or extended family and friends networks. For example, \citeN{Luckin2008} developed the Homework system that serves as a link between the school lessons, teachers and parents, facilitating the involvement of the parents in home learning activities of their children; and \citeN{Hong2012} explores how a social network can support a person with autism in drawing on advice, help and interactions with an extended network of close others, rather than relying on a single primary care-giver and/or the trainer. Such systems extend the support learners can receive from 'experts' in out-of-session contexts. 
%\todo{While interesting, and worthwhile to follow-up on further, to our not much work done here apart from the initial studies?} - Is this necessary? There probably will be other papers we don't know about. 


Existing work also utilises and supports peer feedback and interaction. Many of the behavioural systems mentioned above work with peer cooperation/competition to motivate and engage participants to keep up with their goals, often utilising existing social networks and systems. For example, Power Agent \cite{Gustafsson2009} game uses social facilitation, particularly cooperation (with family members and peers) and competition (with other teams) to facilitate learning of energy saving behaviors in a game setting; and the BinCam \cite{Thieme2012b} leverages social influence, in this case mediated via a social network, to foster reflection and behavior change regarding waste and recycling. %Again, actual input regarding %the issue at hand, in this case pictures of people's garbage, was combined with an application tied into the users' social network in order to support the desired target behaviors. 
%
Similarly, FishSteps \cite{Lin2006} takes advantage of social competition to
influence people to become more physically active; and \citeN{Gasser2006} also use social facilitation to support healthy nutrition and activity. 
Drawing on such peer cooperation or healthy competition could be very beneficial also for many aspects of social and emotional learning.  

Finally, social support can be facilitated also by strangers, as is the case with online social networks and support groups. These has been extensively studied and used (see e.g., \cite{Barak2008,Newman2011}), especially in the context of patients with chronic diseases (e.g., cancer \cite{Skeels2010}), and other stressful periods in life (e.g., smoking cessation \cite{Ploderer2013}). The findings point out the potential of online support groups to provide emotional and information support.  %This kind of emotional support also has a positive effect on the longer term commitment of users \cite{Wang2012}, highlighting its relevance as a motivational factor.  
Whereas social support groups have been mainly used for distress situations, where users come to discuss their issues and receive information or experiences from others, it would be interesting to explore if a similar model of social support and encouragement is viable also for (parts of) social and emotional skills learning. % Examples from \todo{personal well-being/sports/running sites and massive online learning courses hint that it might be possible.}

Large body of work in HCI focuses at creating engaging experiences, showing the potential of technology and design to enhance users' engagement with a wide range of aspects, activities and concepts such as \todo{work ref}, school education \cite{Connolly2012}, digital art \cite{Edmonds2013}, stroke rehabilitation \cite{Balaam2011a}, \todo{personal wellbeing ref} to name just a few. This breadth of topics, as further illustrated, e.g., in the Funology book \cite{blythe2004funology} and subsequent research, suggests the high potential of similar approaches to augment many aspects across the curricula, making social and emotional skills learning more engaging and motivating.

The recent uptake of systems that aim to support users' engagement through 'gamification' or 'gameful design' \cite{Deterding2011,McGonigal2011} could be particularly relevant to social and emotional skills curricula,  integrating game mechanics like rewards, goals, points or challenges into real life activities.  
%
%\todo{pull out very specific examples, then link back to behavioural change and its motivational aspects -- or rather say this is something behave change draws on as well?}
For example, Superbetter\footnote{\url{http://www.superbetter.com/}} aims to help players to increase their personal resilience, using a structure of quests, adversaries, and power-ups to engage players with scientifically endorsed exercises. Other applications in this area are related to behaviour change technologies, such as supporting users to become more fit (e.g. via activity tracking sensors coupled with gamified services such as Nike+ and Fitbit), lose weight  (Withings) or to improve people's sleep (Zeo). 
%
Gamification approaches have been also successfully applied in education (e.g., \cite{torres2011quest,Sheldon2011,Mamykina2008}), as well as therapy work \cite{Goh2008,Piper2006}. %\cite{Liu2010} to support English learning, not only leading to increased motivation but also to improved outcomes when compared to a conventional learning setting. 
Several game-based systems looking at social skills with children also report positive effects and high engagement of the users, e.g., \cite{Hourcade2013,Hendrix2009a}.

All of these examples highlight the possibility of technology based systems to create intrinsically motivating applications that draw user in and are fun to interact with, regardless of the activity or behaviour to be supported.

% {{{ Summary

\subsection{Summarising technology roles across learning principles}    

This section presented a range of successfully deployed---or potentially deployable---HCI systems. The presentation was so far structured according to the learning principles the technology could support (showing HCI can address the key challenges), rather than the similarities in the role technology played across all principles. 

To provide such a complementary view, as well as to illustrate the wide range of potential technology support we've seen so far, we outline some of the key roles below.  While this differenciation is one of many possible, we believe it can be useful here to illustrate the variety of options technology can bring. It also points to the complexity of the design space and emphasises that supporting a particular learning principle does not necessarily prescribe a particular role technology needs to take.

%We now discus according to the similarities in the role technology plays there rather than the learning principles they support:   %\rephrase{A rough distinction of the benefits offered by technology that appeared repeatedly could be to distinguish:}
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item {\bf Expert sensing:} Some of the systems rely on sensing and automated interpretation of behaviour, helping users draw out patterns they were not aware of before. Information can be presented in real-time, such as giving feedback on communication behaviour in meetings \cite{Kim2008,DiMicco2007}, or over longer periods of time such as in AffectAura \cite{McDuff2012}. Such systems often draw on and connect many disparate data sources. 
                
                %\todo{this is future?} taking over some of the feedback from the trainers/peers or giving additional one (\cite{fjklds,fds,fsd,fsd,sdf}). 


                \item {\bf Structuring activities:} Other systems aim to provide timely reminders to support users behaviour. They may provide data for the user to reflect and act on, but rely much less on automatic sensing and interpretative capabilities of technology, leaving the interpretation to the user. Examples can be found in autism technology such as MOSOCO system \cite{Escobedo2012} listing the appropriate actions the person should take and asking them to rate their performance (i.e., no sensing on the part of the system); personal reflection tools, such as Affect Diary \cite{Stahl2008} or [SenseCam ref]; or facilitating keeping of diaries in therapy \cite{Matthews2011}.  

                \item {\bf Novel experiences:} A third role we saw systems take was to facilitate or create novel experiences. This can be either by providing a 'new world' to behave in,  as per (serious) games \cite{Hailpern2011} and virtual reality \cite{Bouchard2012,Romano2005};  or by helping the users to get a novel perception of a particular behaviour such as through gamification of real-world experience (e.g., Superbetter app) and  the accentuated feedback in systems developed by \citeN{Bailenson2008}. 

                \item {\bf Connecting and sharing:} Fourth role was in supporting connecting and sharing among larger groups of users. For example, facilitating cooperation of a larger number of users [ref], or reaching out to potential social support nets (e.g., \cite{Newman2011}), or the family/friends circle (e.g., \cite{Hong2012, Munson2010}).

% {{{ SECTION: Future research agenda

\section{Mapping out the design space -- opportunities and challenges for HCI}
\label{sec:agenda}
We now complement the earlier sections, structured by social skills curricula aspects, and turn to discuss the specifics of the design landscape for the HCI research in the area of social and emotional skills.  

In particular, previous sections have so far looked at what social skills curricula focus on and where the challenges lie (sec 2-4);  and then provided examples showing how these challenges and learning principles are likely to be supported by technology (sec 5).  While drawing out some of the HCI research that is already very relevant to these domains, section 5 was however still structured by the learning principles and social skills learning challenges, aiming to show that HCI has high potential to address many of the key issues there. 

In this section take a different viewpoint and outline the challenges (and thus also opportunities for growth) that supporting social and emotional skills curricula would pose to HCI, across the learning principles and curricular domains. We focus on four main areas:



\begin{itemize}
        \item We first discuss the {\bf implications of the facilitated nature} of the social skills learning curricula, leading to distinguishing inside and outside of the training session as two core settings for design of systems in this area. We outline how they differ in their affordances, possible target groups of users to design for, and the differences in what types technology could be most useful in each; also highlighting the need for technology that would help connect together the learning processes inside/outside. 
        \item Second, we discuss the {\bf challenges for technology} posed by the social skills learning space. We start with the two key technical challenges in this space: sensing interpersonal signals relevant to social skills teaching, and the need for adaptability and modularity of technology due to the complexity of the curricula to be supported. We then briefly discuss many other challenges that are shared with other ubiquitous applications (e.g., privacy, ethics, timely feedback, up-keep of deployed technology).  
        \item Third, we look at some of the {\bf design challenges} this space poses. Apart from the common issues again shared by other ubiquitous applications, we draw out two more specific aspects: On one hand, the focus on designing technology that facilitates or 'scaffolds' learning of skills, but is expected to be removed once the skills are learned. On the other, there is a potential for a large scale, real-world impact of technology that would get incorporated into curricula. However, this comes together with the design challenges connected to the complex, multi-disciplinary interventions to be supported, which involve many stakeholders and policy decisions as well as strict requirements on cost-effectivity and robustness of developed technology. 
        \item Fourth, we briefly outline some of the {\bf methodological challenges} brought by cooperation with large scale interventions and educational research. These draw on differences in the structure and time span of research on educational curricula, and the approaches common in HCI. Similarly, the evaluation of the developed technologies might require novel methodology approaches, perhaps drawing on and re-appropriating the knowledge already existing educational and related domains. We conclude with a short discussion about what could be the role and contribution of HCI in this space.   
        
\end{itemize}

% {{{ Inside/outside implications
\subsection{Implications of facilitated learning -- possible settings}
\label{sec:facilitated}

One of the defining features of social skills learning curricula is the combination of facilitated teaching, i.e., learning under a guidance of an expert trainer, and the interplay between learning processes during and outside of the learning sessions. 
Figure~\ref{fig:in-out-dim} flags up our brief discussion on how inside/outside of training sessions differ in terms of affordances, target user groups and types of technology that could be used. 

In particular, we suggest that although one of the key HCI contributions to social emotional learning courses could be extending the learning support \emph{beyond} in-session learning, developing systems for the in-session contexts can be a good first step, both in terms of testing the technology, as well as being directly useful to the teaching process. We suggest that in-session learning is an interesting design space in which novel technologies can be developed -- marrying the benefit of direct application into and testing within real-world scenarios, with the possibility to do so within well constrained and manageable environment.

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/in-out.png}
        \caption{Summarising the ley differences between in- and out-of-session learning settings}
        \label{fig:in-out-dim}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{In-session learning}
Learning sessions typically take place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present. This leads to a limited, often quite controllable settings for technology deployment and points to particular user roles that can be designed for, such as supporting the trainer's expert role (augmenting and enhancing rather than replacing their skills), facilitating peer's feedback or group reflection on examples, or directly supporting the individual learners.

Additionally,  the training experiences have a particular quality of being ``real'' and ``not-so-real'' at the same time: often asking participants to practice and try new skills out in a ``safe place'' (e.g., through role play), where potential failures in interaction are actually a valuable basis for reflection and learning, and the expert trainer can immediately assist if problems appear. In this sense, such in-session training is a `real' situation in terms of the learning setting, but \rephrase{fictional} and `unreal' for the participants, and also a situation that is specifically open to, and designed for, external feedback and reflection. 

The combination of the in-class space and the specificity of training experiences potentially allows for a more pervasive technology deployment than would be possible in every-day life. Many of the pragmatic and ethical challenges present outside of the classroom are relaxed, such as the possibility to affect, interrupt and shape the interactions; being less difficult to obtain consent with data collection; %, which straightforward for in-sessions learning, but less so ``in the wild''; 
or the fact that the situation is role-played and thus (most probably) less personally sensitive for participants. Moreover, the 'controlled' training spaces have many additional advantages such as the potential for easier initial technology deployment and lower robustness requirements; or the potential for easy collection of training data corpuses for automated approaches such as SSP or affective computing --- while still working with the "real" learning process (i.e., not an instrumentally designed laboratory task). The curricula are often well structured, with prepared exercises and model situations known in advance, which can also ease initial deployment of technology. 


\subsubsection{Out of session learning}
Everyday life automatically offer many opportunities in which practicing of social skills is possible. Such practice serves an important role in most curricula as it supports successful transfer of learn behaviours into learners' lives. 
%
The key issue is however that---in contrast to the in-session learning---learners can receive only very little support from the trainer or peers in these settings; thus skills that are not developed completely are hard to practice successfully. Learners can slip back into their old habits (perhaps not even knowing they are doing so), might not even attempt to try the skills (as the situation is too important), or would need external facilitation to practice successfully.  

This points to a number of roles technology is likely to support when facilitating learning outside. As discussed earlier, systems can focus on individual learners and possible ways in which they can be supported in their practice (e.g., through feedback) and reflection on their behaviours. Alternatively, technology might attempt to seed a supporting environment for the learners through facilitating involvement their social networks such as family, friends, colleagues into the learning process, supporting peer interaction and support outside of the in-session, or even providing links for trainers intervention or support even outside of the learning session. 

The ``in-the-wild'', everyday setting has also implications for technologies used. Mobile and wearable nature are likely to be key, together with the need to blend with and into everyday behaviours %(or practice in sociological sense -- \todo{ ask eva for a different word}) 
and still provide meaningful feedback or benefit. Given the interpersonal nature of many social skills, any sensing which might involve others than the learner outside of in-session learning will need to address many additional complex design and ethical challenges. 

Still, supporting and facilitating learning outside of direct learning sessions is the key challenge for social and emotional skills curricula at the moment. We have also seen examples of HCI research in previous sections that have dealt with these successfully (e.g., \cite{Escobedo2012,Tentori2010,Matthews2011}), suggesting that it is possible to provide beneficial intervention even in such complex settings. 


\subsubsection{Connecting in-/out-session learning}
Another important area for technology support is supporting connections between  in- and out-session learning. We envision that much has to be possible to extend the current ``homework'' approach used in the curricula, where the learners are asked to do particular exercise in between sessions and then report back (in person, via an essay, kept diary etc.).  Obvious examples of potential for technology support are to use technology to track progress or practice, or collect (video/audio) data to support post-hoc reflection or analysis within sessions; as well as support channels to get information/help from the learners even when outside of the session (as discussed above). However, we expect many other, more sophisticated ideas are possible, each drawing on the particularities of the curricula and domain to be supported. An example of such technology, albeit aimed at learning mathematics rather than social skills, is the Homework project \cite{Luckin2008}, where 5-7 year olds were given tablets and a specialised software connecting class work, homework exercises, and facilitating parents' involvement. 


 




%\subsubsection{\todo{Summary text:}} if needed. 
        
%       Majority of activities and learning aspect in all courses consist of \emph{facilitated learning}, regardless of the domain. We argue below that this points to an interesting design space in which novel technologies can be developed, marrying the value of direct application into and testing within real-world scenarios, with the possibility to do so within well constrained and manageble environment.  Whereas one of the key HCI contributions to social emotional learning courses could be extending the learning support \emph{beyond} classrooms and directly facilitated learning, developing systems for the such facilitated contexts can be a good first step, both in terms of testing the technology, as well as being directly useful to the teaching process.

% {{{ Technology aspects
\subsection{Technology challenges}
\label{sec:techAspect}
 We outline the some of the challenges that technology deployment will face in the area of social and emotional learning. While many of these are shared with other ubiquitous applications, some are more specific. First is the sensing and processing of aspects relevant to feedback on social skills that are mostly based on interpersonal interaction and complex concepts. Second is related to the complexity of many curricula and the need to make technology support particularly adaptable, modular and re-usable. 

\iffalse
% {{{
\subsubsection{Possible roles for technology}   We've seen a range of successfully deployed---or potentially deployable---systems in the previous section. However, the presentation there was structured according to the learning principles the technology could support, rather than the similarities in the role it plays. We illustrate below the roles we've seen so far, 
%We now discus according to the similarities in the role technology plays there rather than the learning principles they support:   %\rephrase{A rough distinction of the benefits offered by technology that appeared repeatedly could be to distinguish:}
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item {\bf Expert sensing:} Some of the systems rely on sensing and interpretation of behaviour, helping users draw out patterns they were not aware of before. Information can be presented in real-time, such as giving feedback on communication behaviour in meetings \cite{Kim2008,DiMicco2007}, or over longer periods of time such as in AffectAura \cite{McDuff2012}. Such systems often draw on and connect many disparate data sources. 
                
                %\todo{this is future?} taking over some of the feedback from the trainers/peers or giving additional one (\cite{fjklds,fds,fsd,fsd,sdf}). 


                \item {\bf Structuring activities:} Other systems aim to provide timely reminders to support users behaviour. They may provide data for the user to reflect and act on, but rely much less on automatic sensing and interpretative capabilities of technology, leaving the  interpretation to the user. Examples can be autism, e.g., \cite{Escobedo2012}, listing the appropriate actions the person should take and asking them to rate their performance (i.e., no sensing on the part of the system); personal reflection tools, such as Affect Diary \cite{Stahl2008} or [SenseCam ref]; or facilitating keeping of diaries in therapy \cite{Matthews2011}.  

                \item {\bf Novel experiences:} A third role we saw systems take was facilitate or create novel experiences. This can be either by providing a 'new world' to behave in,  as per (serious) games \cite{Hailpern2011} and virtual reality \cite{Bouchard2012,Romano2005};  or by helping the users to get a novel perception of a particular behaviour such as through gamification of real-world experience -- [ref behavioural change tech, others?] or the magnified feedback offered by \citeN{Fox2009,Bailenson2008}. 

                \item {\bf Connecting and sharing:} Fourth role was in supporting connecting and sharing among larger groups of users. For example, facilitating cooperation of a larger number of users from the same course (Massive online courses?, plus ref from section 5.3), or reaching out to potential social support nets (family/social circle in Three Good Things). 
        \end{enumerate}

%\todo{The first two maybe don't work -- mixing together 'patterns over time' and 'making invisible visible', no clear distinction otherwise -- apart from the expert/non-expert approach. Do we combine these together then?}
        
 \rephrase{While this structuring is one of many possible, we believe it can be useful to illustrate the variety of options technology can bring. It also points to the complexity of the design space and emphasising that supporting a particular learning principle does not necessarily prescribe a particular role technology needs to take.}

%\subsubsection{Specific challenges for technology}

%\rephrase{A bit of leading text should be here -- plus I'm still thinking about how to make the visual structuring work here (as I want to put the two specific aspects under one section, but make them obviously visible)}


\subsubsection{Sensing of interpersonal aspects} Automatic capture and processing of data that is robust and reliable is often difficult in the wild, especially if it is to be meshed fluidly with other complex interactions (as will be the case in both in-session and out of session systems here). However, sensing and processing of aspects relevant to social skills is likely to be challenging by itself, even in controlled laboratory conditions.

This is partly due to the interpersonal nature of the sensed data, which has not been common in SSP, affective computing or related fields that focus so far mostly on individuals \cite{Vinciarelli2012}. Additionally, many of the social concepts taught in the courses are holistic and are yet to be defined in a way that would allow automatic sensing; it might be even impossible for some. Support for social and emotional skills courses thus raises many well-motivated research questions around which aspects can be sensed and interpreted\footnote{An intriguing parallel can be seen in psychology of interpersonal judgments, where large body of research shows that human raters can reliably judge complex concepts such as perceived warmth or friendliness of an conversation on the macro level (gut instinct), but even after many studies micro-coding many of the non-verbal signals (head nods, movements etc.), it is still unclear what cues intuitive judgement of the raters draws upon.}, and whether that is possible on the individual or interpersonal level (i.e., combining sensed data across participants).

There is also a question of the level of interpretation we expect the system to provide. This leads to a continuum from leaving the sense-making of raw data entirely on the user (e.g., as per SenseCam systems \cite{Fleck2009}) to full interpretation provided by the system (e.g., arousal detection for autism patients \cite{Picard2009}). Especially, even if particular concepts cannot be reliably and fully interpreted by technology, it might still be possible, and in many cases actually preferable, to support the users' by providing a 'reasonably' pre-processed data they can view, interpret and reflect on. 



\subsubsection{Complexity of curricula -- need for adaptability and modularity}
Complexity of curricula and the wide range of skills that are usually taught are another challenge. This suggests the need for modularity of the designed systems and preference for highly versatile and re-usable designs that can be adapted for teaching many aspects within the curricula. %\rephrase{Immediate ideas are either to support an underlying process (e.g., reflection) in such a way that it can be applied to multiple scenarios, or }
%
%
Cost-benefit ratio and robustness of the system will be also important, both in terms of durability and reliable sensing in difficult real-world environments, regardless of context and setting. These will be especially crucial if the aim is to deploy technology as a part of existing curricula. 
%
Technology will also need to adapt to the differences among domains and settings, and the related variances in the length, focus and breadth of curricula, even when supporting a concept important across the domains (such as self-reflection). For example, we expect differences between designing for young (such as education curricula and therapy for adolescents) and adult learners (e.g., business and medical domain courses); differences in supporting professional or personal social skills etc.

%  -- e.g., point to the differences in social judgements on macro and micro level 
\subsubsection{Challenges shared with other ubiquitous systems} Many of the challenges in this design space are shared with other ubiquitous computing applications. For example  providing timely, unobtrusive feedback is often a challenge for ubiquitous applications, even if the sensing and processing issues described above are resolved; as are issues around managing and keeping the technology running once deployed. Privacy needs to be addressed whenever a system includes sensing or data collection,  especially so if the goal is to sense interpersonal aspects of an interaction. Finally, ethical concerns regularly arise, particularly when working in sensitive settings such as education of young learners or in the medical domain. 
For a more detailed discussion of such issues in other contexts see e.g., \citeN{Caceres2012}, \citeN{Consolvo2007} or \citeN{Kientz2007}.
% }}}


% {{{ Design challenges
\subsection{Design challenges}

Similarly to above, many challenges are shared with other ubiquitous systems, but some are quite specific. We start by discussing two such key aspects that are particularly relevant to social and emotional learning skills. First is a combination of an opportunity and a challenge: the potential for large scale, real-world impacts \emph{if} the technology is accepted by the curricula design community, which however brings the need to closely cooperate with curricula designers and serious challenges due to the particularities of the setting, interdisciplinarity, interactions with policy makers etc. Second is designing technology as a scaffolding, i.e., aim to help teach new skills over a limited period of time, after which the technology is taken away, but the skills stay. 
We then continue with the more common ubiquitous tech design decisions, drawing out those that might be particularly relevant to this area.
 
%\subsubsection{Specific challenges} \rephrase{Same issue with the leading text as per above ... }
%\label{sec:designSpecChal}
        \subsubsection{Need for cooperation and knowledge sharing with curricula designers}
        The learning principles identified earlier---together with curricula descriptions available in literature---are likely to help initial explorations of the design space. However, developing systems either in collaboration with curricula designers, or directly for specific existing curricula will be crucial for real-world usefulness and deployment of the developed systems. %In other words, it doesn't make sense to design and deploy new curricula within HCI, but rather cooperate with curricula designers and use their knowledge to jointly find most effective and beneficial ways to include technology into novel or existing curricula designs. 
        \citeN{Coyle2007} have discussed this issue with respect to designing for mental-health domain; and \citeN{Porayska-Pomsta2011} address the challenges of similar interdisciplinarity in designing for autism. We will argue in the next section how their approach can be extended to whole setting of social and emotional skills, and return to the methodological challenges brought about by such interdisciplinary cooperation. 

%Their arguments based on lack of access of HCI researchers to mental-health treatment settings due to many aspects, e.g., ethics. While some aspect of education or bussiness areas raise lower ethical issues than mental health therapies, it will still be crucial to draw on the long-term knowledge of curricula design professionals and cooperate. 

\subsubsection{Designing to ``teach and disappear''} Most of social and emotional skills courses, irrespective of domain, run only for a limited time. This can be often as short as a few hours or a weekend long training course; or span longer time periods, but then are again limited to several hours every week (e.g., K9 school curricula). 
In both cases, the aim is to facilitate development of new skills over the duration of the course, but it is crucial that the skills stay even after the course is finished. 
Although it might be relevant for some cases to develop technology that allows to extend or supplement the course duration, the ultimate goal of technology is likely to scaffold and help learn skills that will stay available \emph{after} the technology is taken away. This provides interesting and novel challenges to designing systems, especially with the potential to enriching approaches used in behavioural change and related fields. Additionally, such focus calls for designs that can adapt and follow the learning curve of students, always supporting the next `zone of proximal development'. 


\subsubsection{Design challenges shared with other ubiquitous systems }
        Designing for social and emotional skills is also likely to raise many issues that have been already widely discussed in earlier work around ubiquitous systems and related technology. These can be challenges around privacy and the degree of control given to users; need for adaptability and personalisability, as well as designing with sensitivity to different cultures. Other factors will likely involve decisions around making the technology individualised or shared by many; the feedback style (give ``expert'' opinions, or leave interpretation open to users) or feedback mode (ambient vs. explicit feedback), as well as the need to include many potentially competing requirements (e.g., the need to address most if not all learning principles). Pragmatics will also come into play including issues around designing for difficult settings (e.g., schools with high violence and poverty rates); or supporting training and ease of use of technology for trainers and learners, especially in large-scale deployments.  %As described earlier, the designs will also need to address most if not all learning principles in each system.
See, e.g., \citeN{Consolvo2007} or \citeN{Rogers2007} for an in depth discussion of similar issues.
% }}}

% {{{ Methodology 
\subsection{Methodological challenges}
Research on social and emotional skills will likely bring also novel methodological challenges, especially if the aim is inclusion or co-design of the technology in large-scale curricula projects, and it's acceptance by curricula designers and policy makers. This section focuses mainly on such co-operative projects, as these are likely to have the highest potential for large-scale impact of HCI research; but also present specific challenges. We discuss three interrelated issues: structure and methods usually imposed on research in curricula design projects; the approaches to evaluation in these domains; and the possible roles HCI could take in this space. 

\subsubsection{Structure and methods}
Curricula tend to be very complex, large scale interventions, especially so in the education and the medical settings. Designing technology for these settings will need to take into account the longer term time-span and intense focus of research projects in these domains, where it is usual to take many years to develop and test a curriculum. For example, \citeN{Matthews2011} show how such co-operation is possible and discussing the development, deployment and a clinical trial of a mobile-phone support for therapy with adolescents. 

Although it is potentially challenging to accommodate this in the quicker turn-around of projects usual in the HCI space, such sustained focus and long-term research agenda may have beneficial impact on research on social skills and interaction within HCI more generally. Whereas existing HCI work on teaching social and emotional skills has been mostly fragmented (except perhaps for autism research), often in form of single studies, with little follow-up, the structure inherent in SEL curricula might promote more systematic research and lead to highly successful, real-world applications. Such projects could enrich HCI approaches with methodologies, contexts and goals that are well defined, well researched and very well motivated by real-world needs. 


\subsubsection{Evaluation approaches}
Approaches to evaluation methodologies also tend to differ between curricula designers and most of HCI work. There is a push for an ``evidence based'' support for curricula interventions, as required by the policy makers. This leads to a sequence of increasingly complex studies, starting from formative, small pilot studies that test viability of particular ideas; through larger, longer term studies to confirm potential; but eventually building up to multi-site trials, often in the form of randomised control trials or similarly resource intensive methodologies such as complex quasi-experimental designs, which are less common in HCI.  So although there is a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods inherent in the design and initial exploration of curricula, there is a call for mostly quantitative methods to test the effects of a developed curriculum. This can impact the roles HCI might take in this domain, as discussed in the next section. 

%Additionally, it will be challenging to develop, or find already established, methodologies to support the initial short term, iterative design of systems important for HCI.


\subsubsection{Roles for HCI}
The complexity, scale and dependencies of such large-scale projects necessarily affect ways in which we as HCI practicioners can engage.  An extensive discussion of similar issues in related domains is already available. 
%, as already discussed in section \ref{sec:designSpecChal}. 
%
For example, \citeN{Coyle2007} suggests a two stage process in the area of talk-based therapies, where the first exploratory part is led by HCI with cooperation from experts from the other domain, aiming to iteratively develop and run initial evaluations of promising systems to the point ``where they are shown to be usable by the target end users, are agreed to have clinical validity and are predicted to have therapeutic benefits.'' Stage two then focuses on larger scale evaluations and the roles exchange: the lead is assumed by the curricula experts with HCI researchers in a collaborating role, and receiving feedback on the systems use in real-world practice.
\citeN{Fitzpatrick2012} discuss similar issues in their review of CSCW systems in medical settings, arguing for the need to engage with and raise awareness of CSCW (and HCI related) issues with many of the stakeholders. 

We suggest a combination of the \citeN{Coyle2007} model of cooperation with curricula designers, complemented %for social skills learning systems, aiming to develop systems with immediate practical use and deployment; 
with another stream of more independent, smaller, exploratory studies that try to push the boundaries of what might be possible to do with technology in the first place.  In other words, we can see benefit in parallel research on two areas: (i) aiming for large scale, real-world impact with technologies/ideas that are already matured in HCI, in close cooperation with curricula designers and large interdisciplinary projects; and (ii) more exploratory HCI process, that draws on existing curricula and the challenges, bringing novel, untested technology and exploring a broad range of viable approaches that eventually feed into the first stream. It is our hope that this article could inspire future work pursuing either of the two direction.

\iffalse
The previous sections unpacked the learning  principles identified earlier, linking them to existing work within HCI and pointing out how such \rephrase{combination} might be especially useful for SEL, by providing novel opportunities to teach and learn social skills.  
This section highlights the challenges and opportunities doing so might raise for HCI. 

% %Previous section discussed ways in which HCI could help support teaching of social and emotional skills as well as address challenges existing within SEL learning curricula.  as well as for HCI through \rephrase{interacting} with an interesting new domain for which useful applications can be developed and, by doing so, inspire further research within HCI.



Focus on social and emotional provides a way of structuring and inspiring novel research on social interaction within HCI by bringing methodologies, contexts and goals that are well defined, well researched and very well motivated. Whereas existing HCI work on teaching social and emotional skills has been mostly fragmented, often in form of single studies, with little follow-up or elaboration, the structure inherent in SEL curricula might promote more systematic research, higher comparability of and building on existing studies, and lead to highly successful, real-world applications. 
%
For example, the goals of social and emotional skills learning are complementary with existing HCI research that focuses supporting, enhancement and automatic analysis of social interaction, suggesting novel and well-motivated real-world applications for much of social signal processing and related research. 
%
Moreover, the topic of SEL within education also gains increasing political support in the US and Europe \todo{refs -- e.g., Seligman2009,Cohen2006}, suggesting that social and emotional learning programs for schools might be soon included in most schools. The situation is similar also for the other domains, with SEL programs already flourishing in business and being on the rise within the medical domain. Overall, SEL provides a novel design space for HCI that could have a strong, positive impact on everyday life of a large population. 

More generally, training contexts such as the courses described here are an interesting design space in and of themselves as they could provide a valuable initial context in which to consider the design of other novel systems supporting life skills teaching and long-term development. Such training contexts keep all the \rephrase{positives} described in the Facilitated learning section \ref{sec:facilitated}. It also leaves open opportunities for technologies (and practice situations) that could not be applied in everyday settings for various reasons, such as simulating situations and interactions that are potentially dangerous or emotionally challenging.



        %\item Of interest for HCI is also that most of the curricula take training of the teachers very seriously, suggesting another potential settings where novel technology could be utilised and be very useful.

                \item while there is a broad potential for application within the existing curricula and courses, doing so will require robust technology and cost-efficiency aspects, especially if one aims for a wider deployment.
\item Efficient communication: Related to the issue of cost efficient wider deployment mentioned above, a potential system for SEL needs to support efficient communication between a coach/trainer and a large number of students. This entails providing a high level overview of the student cohorts progress and providing pointers to individuals and situations where feedback from the trainer is indicated without overwhelming them with every detail that the system is currently tracking. This entails the need for the development of machine learning (big data) approaches that help to differentiate between situations which could be successfully handled by the system and where an intervention by the trainer is required.   
                \item How do we deal with the need for interdisciplinarity, as identified by \citeN{Porayska-Pomsta2011} or \citeN{Coyle2007}. \rephrase{Emphasise the need for co-development with the practitioners. }
                \item Real systems will need to combine most of the challenge categories above -- example of MOSOCO, which helps receive peer feedback, aims to support practice in the wild, and keep engagement through gamifying the situations (earning stars, comparison etc.). 
%               \item Successful examples of autism related systems ==> how will similar approaches extend to NT conditions, where most of the processes taught are much less structured, harder to track, and even specify?
\item balancing necessary user tracking with privacy concerns:  As SEL involves vulnerable user groups such as students and confidental situations, e.g. doctor-patient communication or therapy settings, the technologies used to facilitate practice and to foster the embedding of these skills into everyday situation need to guarentee the privacy of the involved parties. This is particularly important during facilitated learning, where feedback from a trainer is a crucial component. The system needs to enable feedback by the trainer/coach by giving them the necessary information about the learning situation but do so without revealing any details about the involved stakeholders without their consent.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
        This paper attempted to outline what we see as a great potential for synergy between HCI and social and emotional skills learning, benefiting both disciplines.       
%
Social and emotional skills learning is crucial for diverse domains, such as education (from kindergarten to high-school), business, medical and everyday settings reviewed earlier. It is therefore relevant for an exceedingly wide range of potential learners, and not limited to special-needs groups such as autism or psychotherapy patients.
%
Moreover, each domain has a history of specialised curricula and peer-reviewed studies of their efficiency, showing that social and emotional skills are teachable and training  can have long-term, positive effects. 
        

However, current approaches still face key challenges. We particularly drew out issues around providing timely feedback (currently post-hoc, coming from trainer/peers), opportunities for real-world practice (currently limited mostly to in-session training), embedding learnt skills into everyday life (very little is possible for curricula designers at the moment), and facilitating engagement and motivation (potential to improve engagement with technology). The overarching challenge across these issues is the need to extend support of out-of-session learning, which is fundamental for social and emotional skills  but hard to facilitate for the current curricula.
         

The review of existing HCI research shows there are strong indications that technology can help address many of these challenges, as discussed in section 5; particularly as many HCI approaches that were not connected to social and emotional learning so far could be directly beneficial here.
%
We argue that HCI involvement in this space has a potential for strong, real-world impacts and that it is likely to bring well-motivated problems to tackle for many developing technologies, raising intriguing novel challenges for future HCI research. 
%
We would like to particularly highlight the key aspects around implications of facilitated learning (and the differences in design settings it brings), finding ways to mesh technology support well with curricula design (building on the long history of research there), and addressing the support for social and emotional learning for neuro-typical children (domain with a long history, many curricula that are widely applied, but so far under-researched in HCI). 
%       \todo{what this means for HCI} 
%       \begin{itemize}
                % build on the special needs research to look at neurotypical groups 
                % Focus on facilitated learning and the design implications it has -- in-class learning as an important settings to start from, and supporting out-of-class, ``in the wild'' learning as a way to address the key challenge. 
%                
%       \end{itemize}
 

Overall, we believe that the work around social and emotional learning points to a complex, intriguing research space, that has a high potential to enrich HCI research and practice. 
%
%The distinction and characterisations we offered here are likely to be only an initial attempt to describe the nuances of the field.
It is our hope that while the characterisations and distinctions suggested in this paper could be useful for immediate future work into this space, further research will elaborate on, clarify and extend, rather than reify, these.

While practice and feedback are central to all approaches to teaching social skills, there are also many other dimensions along which one could distinguish. In particular, practice can take: 
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item facilitated teaching vs. self-maintained
                \item within the classroom/teaching context vs. outside/everyday settings
                \item getting feedback from a trained teacher vs. peers/family/automated system
        \end{enumerate}
        The key challenge recognised in life skills training is supporting {\bf transfer of skills} from the lessons into real-world settings and everyday interactions.



 Based on the literature reviewed above, we identify {\bf four aspects} that are crucial for most of the curricula and each help towards the goal of learning and tranfering life skills. The next four subsection then relate existing HCI literature to these aspects. We will mainly draw on the SEL in education literature to provide specific examples (as it had been described in most detail). 
        %Thus, current skills training curricula are based on procedural learning. 
        
\begin{enumerate}
\item First is emphasis on {\bf feedback} mainly as the skills to be taught are challenging to track easily by the learners themselves. Many life skills are based on social and emotional aspects (e.g., emotional awareness or self-control) -- we will draw out later how recent advances in sensing technology such as affective computing [refs] or social signals processing [refs] could be useful in these aspects. 

\item Second aspect is supporting and facilitating enough {\bf practice}. As life skills are taught through procedural learning [ref?], practice is an inherent part of practically all training approaches, often including role play. In combination with novel feedback technologies, HCI could help extend the possibilities of practice beyond the classroom or provide novel environments in which safe practice is possible. Similarly, to \citeN{Coyle2011}, these environments can build gaming research including multiplayer online worlds, virtual reality and it's existing use in therapy [ref] etc.

\item Third, {\bf embedding activities} outside of the lessons contexts, which helps to hook the learning activities (both as a process as well as the outcomes) into daily life. \todo{needs to be elaborated on -- waiting for Wolfgang to do his bit on the related section below}. %\rephrase{Examples through social networks both online and offline?}

\item Fourth, generally {\bf engagement and motivation} are needed for the lessons to be effective, especially if practice outside of the learning contexts is required. HCI has proven to be quite effective in this in various domains aiming both at adults and children, e.g., behavioural change, cCBT, serious gaming, which suggests similar effects might be useful in life skills courses more widely. 

\end{enumerate}

\todo{This is core argument of the paper ... do we need to be more specific about how these aspects got chosen, or are the arguments in the subsections below sufficient? } \todo{Also point out that}... g., it is likely that applications will at the same time provide feedback, embedded in a serious game to keep engagement and motivation high, and by doing so allow for additional practice. 

%       We identified four key aspects that could be supported by technology:
%               \item training requires extensive {\bf practice}, preferably both during the %lessons as well as outside of them;
%               \item practice needs combination with sufficient {\bf feedback} on own %behaviour, (which often comes from external source such as the trainer);
%               \item to help embed and transfer the skills into everyday life, many %programs set up various {\bf support networks} that aim to extend the training %context to aspects of everyday life; 
%               \item learning social skills is difficult -- {\bf engagement and motivation} %are key aspects for each of the presented curricula. 
%       \end{itemize} 
\medskip
Moreover, most courses in all domains are based on \emph{facilitated learning}, i.e., situation when a small number of instructors leads a potentially high number of students. The sessions typically take place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present. Section~\ref{sec:facilitated} outlines how such training contexts are an interesting design space in and of themselves; as they could provide a valuable initial context in which to consider the design of new systems supporting life skills teaching and long-term development, as well as what opportunities are opened in this context for use of technology.

\subsection{Similarities -- needs and challenges }

\begin{itemize}
        \item We first draw out some initial similarities between all of the areas, among other things to guide the review of HCI literature as well as support the reader in easier understanding how might HCI support such courses.
        \item While we will reference some of the relevant papers, better justification comes in the following sections. 


        \item  As mentioned before, all of the domains mentioned above consider life skills teachable [e.g., refs to reviews?] and many strategies are available. 

        \item Across the areas there is similar emphasis on \emph{facilitated training}, including \emph{support for reflection and awareness} and 
    many life skills taught in facilitated courses
    Training often takes place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present. 
    Moreover, supporting the training experience has a particular quality of being “real” and “not-so-real” at the same time.  It often involves participants trying things out in a “safe place” (e.g., through role play), where potential failures are actually a valuable basis for reflection and learning.
    This opens a new interesting design space and intriguing questions on how could these particular characteristics ease or help development and deployment of new tech?

%{{{ Introduction
\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
        \item Behaviour change is a now a well established sub-field of HCI. 
        
        \item The efforts so far focused mainly on aspects such as supporting sustainable energy consumption and healthy behaviour, developing effective interventions in both. 
        
        \item In this paper, we would like to suggest that there are also other, similarly important areas that are (i) addressable by current or emerging technologies in HCI; (ii) were mostly ignored by the HCI community so far. 
        
        \item In particular, we argue that it is also possible to \rephrase{support and teach social skills} \forGer{-- how to frame it here? Strongest claim possible (but not too complex:) ... aim to claim SEL and medical as examples of  more general social skills training possible? Or is it enough to focus on them specifically?}. \todo{One sentence emphasising how extensive literature shows that social skills can be taught and learned (without details, just a heads-up for the evidence that comes a little later.}
        
        \item In this paper, we focus specifically on \rephrase{programs} supporting development of social skills for children and medical personnel as (i) \todo{social skills are very important here for "this-well-chosen-and-impressive-but-still-succinct-set-of-reasons"}; (ii) an area addressed by long-term research in education and psychology, with a wide range of courses developed, successfully deployed in real-world settings, and proved effective in controlled trials.\rephrase{ For example, \citet{Durlak2011} reports in recent meta-review of 213 school based programs (encompassing more than 270 000 students!) that such programs are effective and  lead to increases in academic performance, lowered aggression  problematic behaviour etc.. \todo{add the "Kids taking part in some of the programs showed an increase of 11-17 percentile points when compared to control group.}}. \todo{Similar example for medical?}
        
        \item Interestingly, only very little technology is used in such courses so far (e.g., only a videocamera to record and analyse an interaction). 

        \item However, \forGer{our analysis shows that?} these programs are often build on similar core concepts to those already addressed by HCI research on behaviour change, suggesting \rephrase{that HCI might help improve programs effectiveness and solve some of the problems that still remain to be addressed}. In particular, \todo{Bring in the main categories of interest we will use later on, to orient the reader to the similarities. Just a placeholder list for now: supporting reflection of own actions, inner emotional state, building habits, and facilitating self-control...  Perhaps a short explicit list linking this to HCI (affective/ubiquitous computing etc.), for the not-so-quick-or-well-read reader?}.

        \item  \rephrase{In this paper, we want to introduce the topic of social skills support into HCI and also aim to suggest how combining emerging technologies together with techniques used in other areas of HCI (such as behaviour change) could help such programs become more efficient. \forGer{How to properly frame the following: I want to spell out that our main goal is to inform HCi that this domain exists, and show why this could not only be a good place to apply knowledge already present in HCI, but also facilitate new interesting questions and approaches.} \todo{Should we argue here how it also connects to the "HCI for human values" etc. approaches?}}

        \item The main contribution of this paper is \todo{reframe per above -- connecting the literature from psychology and educational research on teaching social skills to HCI tools and techniques, opening new areas of interest (teaching social skills as a part of behavioural change direction), providing links to help other HCI researchers to get into the topic quickly? }
        \medskip 

        \item In the rest of this article, we first argue why social skills teaching is an important topic worthy of attention, and provide arguments showing that it can be successfully taught/learned/influenced in various ways. We then review related literature in HCI and related fields. We follow with a more detailed examination of various social and emotional skills programs in medical and educational domains, drawing out common core aspects and/or techniques that, as we argue, could be supported by technology and techniques already existing in HCI. \todo{The technology $\leftrightarrow$ techniques grid?.} We end with pointers to core literature, hoping to kick-start HCI researchers interested to pursue this topic.

%{{{ Social skills matter; and can be taught
\section{Social skills matter; and can be taught}
\begin{itemize}
        \item In this section, we want to argue several points: (i) social skills are important for many aspects of our life and well-being; (ii) there are several domains where an extensive amount of research on how to teach relevant social skills  exists and provides strong arguments why teaching social skills there is needed; (iii) present evidence showing that social skills training can work and have positive, long-term effects. 

        \rephrase{Further sections then show how HCI could be included to enhance possibilities and effectivity of such programs. }
        \item Generally, the concept of social skills span wide range of activities and aspects. In this paper, we chose to focus on two areas, where particular social skills are highly important -- first looks at improving social skills of children in primary/secondary schools; the other at professionals in medical services such as doctors and nurses. We chose these two areas as \todo{both address aspects of significant importance for society and come with a long history of research as well as clinical trials of developed programs. They are also sufficiently different to serve as good examples of the wide range of social skills that can be addressed and taught, but also can point to common concepts shared by such programs.... and similar yaddy yaddy da} 

        \item However, other domains can be addressed in further work,  \todo{e.g., coaching, work-place related soft-skills, etc.} 
        ... as social skills are extremely important for nearly all aspects of our lives. \todo{Pull some general blah from a few papers, I expect it will come up while doing reading for other sections anyway... try to keep it short and use specific positive outcomes of social skills? Can maybe use autism as a negative example (i.e., what problems await if one lacks social skills)? I guess the last Golemans' book could be useful for some arguments/quotes. }
        
        \forGer{The end of the para does not fit all that well -- it is moved from elsewhere and I didn't want to lose it completely as something similar should be included to support our claim that also other social skills training programs outside the two areas we outline can be interesting as well. }

        \item The next two subsections revisit arguments for the importance of social skills in more detail, each focussing mainly on the particular social skills needed in the one of the two domains outlined above. We review evidence showing that (i) various programs developed to teach social skills in these domains exist; (ii) have been already widely deployed; (iii) and proved to be effective in both teaching new social skills to participants as well as \rephrase{facilitating other positive changes brought forth by the new social skills abilities}. 

\todo{I decided to keep "motivation+evidence of positive effect" together and divide the section per topic, i.e., school, then medical. School lit is much stronger than the medical one, so it probably makes sense to make it go first as a whole (and persuade the reader properly), and then say something like "similarly to above, research in medical domain also addresses ... " and just look at the differences}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{School related programs} 
\begin{itemize}
        \item \forGer{Relate development of social skills to mental well-being and problematic behaviour -- thus motivating it} Development of social skills is crutial to mental health, especially for those at risk. School is an important place that helps or hinders such development. Greenberg and others use the language of school-based prevention ... maybe a good term to use as well? Example quotes:


        \qq{Durlak2011}{Extensive developmental research indicates that effective mastery of social-emotional competencies is associated with greater well-being and better school performance whereas the failure to achieve competence in these areas can lead to a variety of personal, social, and academic difficulties (Eisenberg, 2006; Guerra \& Bradshaw, 2008; Masten \& Coatsworth, 1998; Weissberg \& Greenberg, 1998).}

        \qq{NICE review -- Adi2009a}{The Mental Health Foundation (2000) has suggested that children who are mentally healthy will have the ability to: - Develop psychologically, emotionally, creatively, intellectually and spiritually - Initiate, develop and sustain mutually satisfying interpersonal relationships - Use and enjoy solitude - Become aware of others and empathise with them - Play and learn - Develop a sense of right and wrong - Resolve (face) problems and setbacks and learn from them.} .. and continues ... \qq{NICE review -- Adi2009a}{Most of those writing on positive mental health agree on the centrality of positive interpersonal relationships. In the literature relating to children, the concept of emotional intelligence (also called emotional literacy) is often cited (Weare 2000). This relates to the capacity for emotional awareness, emotional regulation, the use of emotional insight in interpersonal negotiations and empathy. (Salovey 1990, Sarni 1997) and is therefore the key to the establishment and maintenance of healthy relationships.}

\qq{Durlak2011}{Many correlational and longitudinal studies have documented connections between social- emotional variables and academic performance (e.g., Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, Bandura, \& Zimbardo, 2000; Wang et al., 1997)}

    


        \item \forGer{Follow by arguing that problems related to social and emotional skills are actually existing in many schools:} \qq{Foster2005}{Nearly three quarters (73 percent) of the schools reported that “social, interpersonal, or family problems” were the most frequent mental health problems for both male and female students. (p. 1).}  ...[follows with] ... \qq{Foster2005}{The problem category that schools reported most frequently as a top mental health issue was social, interpersonal, or family problems. This problem was also most frequently reported to consume the most resources, followed by aggression or disruptive behavior and behavioral problems associated with neurological disorders. (p. 24)} (Foster2005 is a national survey of mental health services in a representative sample of the approximately 83,000 public elementary, middle, and high schools and their associated school districts in the United States.)

        \qq{Durlak2011}{Unfortunately, many students lack social-emotional competencies and become less connected to school as they progress from elementary to middle to high school, and this lack of connection negatively affects their academic performance, behavior, and health (Blum \& Libbey, 2004).}

        \qq{Durlak2011}{In a national sample of 148,189 sixth to twelth graders, only 29\%-45\% of surveyed students reported that they had social competencies such as empathy, decision making, and conflict resolution skills, and only 29\% indicated that their school provided a caring, encouraging environment (Benson, 2006). By high school as many as 40\%-60\% of students become chronically disengaged from school (Klem \& Connell, 2004). Furthermore, approximately 30\% of high school students engage in multiple high-risk behaviors (e.g., substance use, sex, violence, depression, attempted suicide) that interfere with school performance and jeopardize their potential for life success (Dryfoos, 1997; Eaton et al., 2008).}

        

        \item \forGer{show that teaching social skills can help}
        \qq{Weare 2011}{Putting skills at the centre -- The centrality of [social] skills, and, in particular, work using CBT approaches to any effective mental health intervention, was strongly supported by several reviews in this study}

        \qq{Weare2011}{Skills work has been shown to be essential for effective universal interventions for mental health promotion (Adi et al 2007a); social and emotional learning (Durlak et al, 2011), targeted approaches (Shucksmith et al, 2007) depression and anxiety (Blank et al, 2009), conduct disorders (Waddell et al, 2007) violence prevention (Mytton 2002; Adi et al, 2007b) conflict resolution (Garrard and Lipsey, 2007), anger management (Gansle, 2005), bullying (Vreeman and Carroll, 2007) mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression (Neil and Christensen, 2004; Waddell et al, 2007) and emotional disturbance (Reddy et al, 2009).}

        \qq{Weare2011}{Improvements in skills were an outcome explored in 10 reviews across a wide range of issues and there was consensus among them that teaching skills and developing competence is a central part of any comprehensive and effective intervention (Catalano et al., 2002***; Berkowitz and Bier, 2007***; Durlak and Weissberg, 2007***; Shucksmith et al., 2007***)}

        \item \forGer{Define and introduce the wide range of SEL programs }
        \qq{Hoffman2009}{Generally, and for the sake of this analysis, the term SEL refers to programs that attempt to enhance EI and emotional literacy and/or the development of what are perceived to be fundamental social and emotional skills and competencies. These include such things as emotional awareness (being able to recognize and label one’s own and other’s emotions), having the capacity to express and manage emotions appropriately, making responsible decisions or choices, establishing positive social relationships, and handling difficult interpersonal situations effectively.}
        
        \qq{Durlak2011}{Elias et al. (1997) defined SEL as the process of acquiring core competencies to recognize and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, appreciate the perspectives of others, establish and maintain positive relationships, make responsible decisions, and handle interpersonal situations con- structively. The proximal goals of SEL programs are to foster the development of five interrelated sets of cognitive, affective, and behavioral competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005).}


        \item \forGer{Continue with more details -- many developed, and already in place} -- didn't spend much time here yet, as evidence for this part will come naturally when we write the section looking at the programs in details.
        
        \qq{Durlak2011}{A recent review of U.S. school practices found that 59\% of schools already have in place programming to address the development and support of chil- dren’s social and emotional competencies (Foster et.al. 2005)}

        \qq{CASEL}{More than 200 programs available; other sites such as the BluePrints for prevention list selected programs}

        \qq{Weare2011, p64}{Durlak et al. calculated that the effect sizes from the 207 SEL interventions they reviewed averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests, a 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills and a 10\% decrease in class- room misbehaviour, anxiety and depression, effects which held up for at least 6 months after the intervention (Durlak et al., 2011)***.} -- Durlak2011 is a  meta-analysis of 213 school-based, universal social and emotional learning (SEL) programs involving 270,034 kindergarten through high school students.

        \qq{Sussex report}{For example, a recent meta-analysis of 180 universal promotion or prevention programmes for youths (between 5 and 18 years), including those with control group designs, found overall positive effects on social and emotional skills, self-perceptions, peer relations, violence/aggression at school, and academic achievement (Payton et al., 2008)}


        \item \forGer{Strong political support exists as well} --  add quotes and links from the mindmap ... e.g., 

        \qq{Durlak2011}{There is broad agreement among educators, policy makers, and the public that educational sys- tems should graduate students who are proficient in core academic subjects, able to work well with others from diverse backgrounds in socially and emotionally skilled ways, practice healthy behav- iors, and behave responsibly and respectfully (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2007; Greenberg et al., 2003).}

        \qq{US National Research Council}{ Recommendation: The federal government should make the healthy mental, emotional, and behavioral development of young people a national priority, establish public goals for the prevention of specific MEB disorders and for the promotion of healthy development among young people, and provide needed research and service resources to achieve these aims. (13-1)}
        
                \qq{Cherniss2006}{Some states even have passed legislation requiring school districts to incorporate social and emotional devel- opment into their educational programs and to ensure that all students meet social and emotional learning standards that have been integrated into their state learning standards.Forex- ample, based on the Children’s Mental Health Act of 2003 (Public Law93-0495), Illinois students must now meet learning standards directed toward achievement of the following three educational goals by the time they graduate from high school: (a) develop self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve school and life success; (b) use social-awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain positive relationships; and (c) demonstrate decision-making skills and responsible behaviors in personal, school, and community contexts. It is clear that educators and policy makers recognize the need to address children’s social and emotional develop- ment as an important part of education.}

                \qq{CASEL?}{Three pioneering school districts (Anchorage, Alaska; Austin, Texas; and Cleveland, Ohio) have joined an effort called the Collaborating District Initiative, through which they are working to institute SEL curricula in pre-K through 12th-grade classrooms district-wide. All three large, urban districts have installed SEL directors at the cabinet level or just below, an indication of how seriously the superintendents are taking the new approach.

\subsection{Medical contexts}
\begin{itemize}
        \item \forGer{Connect to the kids' literature, brief overview of differences} -- social skills training in medical literature focuses mainly on communication skills, various levels on which this get addressed: (i) medical students, i.e., quite general, core skills; (ii) doctors right after school \todo{there's a word for this}, i.e., more practically oriented courses, but still part of education; (iii) doctors in specific areas, where communication skills are crutial, e.g., cancer care (breaking bad news, helping patients understand and deal with the situation); (iv) care for critically ill such as end-of-life care, i.e., both nurses and doctors, importance of empathy and understanding, helping (rather then getting information, persuading. 
        
        Generally issue of time constraints, opting for shorter courses.. in contrast, some of the curricula for kids took literally years --  but reviews show that longer are much more effective $\Rightarrow$ could this be another application area for HCI, i.e., help reduce overhead, incorporate into practice etc.)

        \item \forGer{Importance of communication skills for doctors}
         
        \qq{Reider2006}{Communication is a core clinical skill that can be taught and learned. A doctor performs 160 000– 300 000 interviews during a lifetime career, making the medical interview the most commonly performed procedure in clinical medicine. [6]} -- Interestingly, Brown2008 has a different number (120 000-160 000) ... we should check with the primary source. 

        \qq{Makoul2007}{Effective communication has been linked with increases in patient and physician satisfaction, better adherence to treat- mentplans,moreappropriate medical decisions, better health outcomes, and fewer malpractice claims.3-6 }

        \qq{Brown2008}{Many studies have reported the importance of effective communication in improving patient health outcomes,[5] in fostering patient compliance to treatment [6] and in improving patient satisfaction with the medical encounter.[7,8]} 

         \qq{Kalet2004}{Particular qualities of the doctor-patient interaction have been shown to be major determinants of the biological, psychological, social, and legal outcomes of care; efficiency and cost-effectiveness of care; iatrogenic harm created in the course of care; and patient and physician satisfaction with the relationship. 13-25}

         Motivational interviewing .. some well chosen quote from one of the books in my office :) 

         \qq{Back2007}{Patients with life-threateting illnesses need physicians with excellent communication skills, yet what they encounter in the physician’s office is often suboptimal.[1-8] [...] The communication skills required in these settings go beyond basic interviewing taught in medical school; complex biomedical issues must be integrated with patient-centered values.}

         \item \forGer{Need for communication skills training}
         \qq{Brown2008}{Aspegren and Lonberg-Madsen [9] reported that doctors who had not undertaken communication skills training were unable to demonstrate important basic communication skills, even after 10 years or more of post-registration clinical work. Willis et al. [10] reported that medical students who had received CCS training had a rich conceptualisation of communication and felt that training had helped them understand the needs of their patients.}

         \qq{Levinson2011}{Ironically, some of [modern examination technologies] have taken precedence over one of the most important skills of the compassionate physician --- the art of listening to the patient. Patients often experience physicians as being too busy to listen and too distant to care.}

         \qq{Kalet2004}{This preclinical curricular approach provides limited reinforcement and training during the clinical years, a long-standing concern supported by the early findings of a decline in communication skills during that crucial training phase. [27] Recently, professional groups have begun to create a demand for change. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) reflect the thinking of other academic leaders that the training in these skills must be improved [28-30]. In an effort to participate in their own care, patients have also demanded that physicians communicate better [31-34].}

         \qq{Gysels2005}{Effective communication is not something that develops automatically over time and with experience [12]. However, health professionals can be trained in communication skills [3, 13]. }

         \qq{Tulsky2011}{Oncologists frequently miss opportunities to respond to patient emotion and may instead exhibit behaviors that block feelings and create emotional distance (8, 9).}


         \item \forGer{Various curricula and courses implemented, and have positive outcomes}

         \qq{Kalet2004}{U.S. medical schools generally teach communication skills during the first or second year. In 1978, 35\% of schools had a formal preclinical year curriculum in communication skills, and by 1993 the proportion had increased to 65\% of schools.26}

         \qq{Barth2011}{The main purpose of communication skills training (CST) courses in {\bf oncology} is to increase empathy and clarity when conversing with patients and family members as well as to practise strategies on how to deal with difficult situations during consultations. In this model, communication is conceptualised as a basic set of clinical skills that can be changed during training.} ... and later ... \qq{Barth2011}{Setting and formal characteristics of CST -- 
Six studies offered training sessions over consecutive days [11, 13, 32, 36, 38, 39], whereas three studies broke down their courses into several sessions over a period of time [12, 34, 35]. In three studies, a non-continuous training (e.g. supervision, consolidation workshops) was part of the concept of the CST [18, 19, 37]. One study provided no clear information on that [33]. Concerning the intensity of the training in the specific intervention group, five CST courses lasted <24 h [18, 32, 34, 35, 38]. Five CST courses had a minimum duration of 24 h [11–13, 33, 39] and three lasted $\geq$36 h [19, 36, 37].}
        
        \qq{Tulsky2011}{Courses for trainees and attending clinicians have been recently developed to address these shortcomings (10–14). These multiday courses incorporate skills training, small-group practice with simulated patients, observation, and feedback (15). Such courses are effective (16) but are often time- and cost- prohibitive.}

        oncologists' programs: \qq{Stiefel2010}{it has been shown that they can be modified and improved by specific training programmes [7, 10, 12–15] and (J. Barth and P. Lannen, unpublished data). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that if effective methods are used, the new skills can be transferred into a clinical setting [13] and their impact is enduring [15, 16]. 
}

        Other reviews looking into effectivity of communication interventions for doctors ... e.g., [Rao2007]


         \item \forGer{Political support} 
         \qq{Levinson2011}{Credentialing bodies, including the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, require trainees to demonstrate competence in communication but also should increase the required standards for teaching and assessing these skills. The American Board of Medical Specialties should incorporate assessment of communication into certification and maintenance of certification. In fact, by 2012, the American Board of Medical Specialties will require some form of peer and patient assessment in maintenance of certification program.}\

         \qq{Makoul2007}{Education and accreditation initiatives have evolved along with the research trajectory. Indeed, the focus on communication now extends throughout the continuum of medical education and practice: US and Canadian medical schools must teach and assess communication skills to maintain accreditation, and interpersonal and communication skills are considered a core area of competency for both residents and practicing physicians.11-13}


         \item CAUTIONARY NOTE: Most of the literature I have above (for medical contexts) looked mainly at doctors, not medical students curricula. Need to search a bit and add this later.

\begin{itemize}
        \item  Social skills and successful social relationships extremely important -- pull  emotional intelligence, the loneliness neuroscience results etc?
   \item 
        \item Political arguments, numbers, dolars, long-term positive outcomes. 
        \item ``This fits well with the Being Human support of values'' arguemtns?
        \item a timely topic, in view of both the maturing technology, as well as the recent emphasis on these programs from US government and other bodies? Also timely in view of the recent surge in social neuroscience results, looking more and more on relationships/interaction than individual emotional processing (pull the Goleman here as well?/also mentioned in the NIH report). 
        \begin{itemize}
                \item when was CASEL started? 
                \item other organisations like blueprints for violence prevention
        \end{itemize}
        \item \todo{How to deal with medical vs. educational focus here?} ... more generally, do we want to have these two fields as examples why it makes sense to support social skills (as a general topic), or as the main drivers for what we are proposing? 
        \item for medical personnel -- distinction between core curriculum for medical students vs. courses for particular classes of doctors (e.g., oncologists etc.) 
        \item where should we emphasise the "social" aspect of what we are proposing? That is, focus on interpersonal interaction, at least dyads etc. Is this inherent in the problems SEL/medical courses try to solve? (keeping cool in situations/doctors' discussions with patients).
