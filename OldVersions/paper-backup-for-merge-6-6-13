\section*{Abstract -- preliminary version}
Social and emotional skills refer to range of skills crucial for virtually all our interactions with others, as well as motivating our own activities. Teaching and learning such skills has a long history, with a large number of evidence-based programs across many domains such as schools, business contexts, or therapy. 
%
However, very little technology gets used, despite its potential to fundamentally enhance and complement the existing approaches.  
%
%Primary aim of this paper is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. 
%
%
We review the literature on social and emotional learning courses across the domains, identifying similarities and shared challenges to successful learning. 
We then link these to HCI research, showing how such connections have the potential to mutually enrich both fields. 
Our key argument is that much of existing HCI work is actually directly relevant to social and emotional skills learning (SEL), but that the topic has been underresearched so far. 

Primary aim of this paper is thus to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We argue below how such technology could fundamentally extend and enhance the possibilities available to social skills curricula designers in other domains, and help addressing some of the key challenges they face. Moreover, we outline the novel opportunities and questions this would pose to HCI. 	


% {{{ SECTION -  Introduction
\section{Introduction}
 
 
Social and emotional skills refer to a range of skills that are crucial for our everyday life and healthy development \cite{Weare2011,Adi2009a,Eisenberg2006?}. We define the term broadly here to include skills such as those related to emotional intelligence, interpersonal and communication skills, but also abilities such as mindfulness, self-control or empathy. The importance of such skills for personal competence and well-being is acknowledged both in research and industry \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Stepien2006,Barth2011,Carey2011,Bono2009}. Social and emotional skills are also particularly valued in domains such as education (from kindergarden to university education), leadership, social work, therapy, or medical personel training, with extensive literature on strategies on how to teach these available. 
	%
%	For example, these can be \emph{education} (across all age ranges, i.e., from kindergarden to university education), \emph{workplace related} (ranging from specific soft-skills courses for employees and business students (such as communication, presentation and conflict management skills) to more general approaches such as executive coaching for managers), \emph{medical personell} (communication skills, empathy for students and practitioners), \emph{therapy} related (psychotherapists training and practice, counselling), \emph{mindfulness and calming technology} (novel area, related to stressful environment and problems with work-life balance, with technology partially to blame -- see e.g., workshop or the interactions paper; approaches to support more sustainable lifestyle). 

We see an increasing number of interventions and courses specifically designed to teach social and emotional skills in these areas, substantiated by a large body of peer-reviewed, scientific literature showing that \emph{such skills are teachable} and \emph{interventions can lead to measurable improvements}. For an example, \citeN{Durlak2011} reviewed the effects of more than 200 interventions within primary and secondary schools, encompassing more than 270000 students. The calculated effect sizes averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests and %, 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills, as well as 
10\% decrease in classroom misbehaviour, with the effects lasting for at least 6 months after the intervention. However, very little technology gets used in the current curricula, despite its potential to help tackle some of the key challenges present.

%	There is growing interest in similar topics within HCI,   %Moreover, as only very little technology support is used in the interventions and curricula in practice at the moment, it leaves many opportunities (and challenges) for improvement. 

%This potential is further supported by the initial work within HCI research relevant to teaching (or influencing) social and emotional skills, and 
There is also a growing interest in HCI on research relevant to teaching or influencing social and emotional skills. For example, existing work focuses on autism \cite{Escobedo2012,Porayska-Pomsta2011,Zarin2011,Tentori2010,Gotsis2010}, using technology to enhance or facilitated therapy \cite{Coyle2011,Matthews2011,DeSa2010,Hancock2010}, as well as smaller scale systems aiming to influence particular social behaviour (e.g., discussion dominance, or rapport), but not being part of any larger intervention or curricula \cite{Narumi2009,Piper2006,Balaam2011,Kim2008,McAtamney2006,Schroyen2008,Kim2008a,Toups2007,Kreitmayer2012,Daily2010}. 
%
%
Wider interest in emotional and social skills within HCI is also exemplified for example by CHI workshops on 'Interaction Design and Emotional Wellbeing' (CHI'12) and 'Patient-Clinician Communication' (CHI'13); as well as a SIG on Work-life Balance. 
\footnote{There is also a dearth of research on using technology to support learning in more classical academic subjects such as mathematics, programing, physics languages etc. \todo{Consider these out of scope for this paper, because .... } }

Still, the potential connections to social and emotional skills training and development have not been addressed in a systematic way so far.
	%\rephrase{Aims of this paper -- review and show how this is relevat}
This paper reviews literature across various external domains where social and emotional skills teaching is key and connects these to what has previously been good but isolated work in HCI with the aim to present a more principled approach to defining a systematic programme for HCI. 
%	how HCI approaches and knowledge could be reappropriated and utilised to enhance existing courses and potentially give rise to new ones, making it a promising topic of further research. 
%, building on what has previously been good but isolated work
%	
	In particular, we argue that there are similar key challenges to teaching social and emotional skills across these domains that can be likely addressed by state of the art technology, and that such focus will also raise new opportunities and challenges to HCI research. We outline the methods and topics social and emotional skills interventions and courses use and draw out key aspects where HCI involvement would be useful.   Moreover, we argue that even much of existing HCI work that was not so far connected to social skills training at all is actually highly relevant and could be very beneficial for augmenting existing curricula. We then provide a roadmap for further research into this topic, outlining such connections in more detail. 
	%
For example, the identified connections build on the emphasis social and emotional skills interventions place on procedural learning, i.e., need for substantial practice and feedback; or on key importance of transfer of learned skills into the real world. We argue how supporting these aspects fits well with and could easily benefit from existing work on topics within HCI such as ubiquitous computing, social signals processing, behavioural change, or ``into the wild'' research. We also outline how the specifics of the learning environment (facilitated, often in-doors) present particularly interesting setting for initial development of new technologies as it provides a real-world setting, in a reasonably controlled environment. 

	% These are supporting complex feedback (based on novel sensors etc.), additional practice opportunities (e.g., based on ubiquitous computing or VR type of systems), embedded networks, and the importance of keeping engagement and motivation (links to behavioural change and gamification) with specific examples. 
	


	See Figure~\ref{fig:journalStructure}  for a diagram of paper structure, and for the overview of the main results. We start with a detailed overview of social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools (Section~\ref{sec:SEL}) We chose to focus on SEL in education as an exemplary domain as it has the longest and most rigorous research, and its the skills set taught is broader than of the other domains. %We argue that it is a good choice as SEL has the longest history of both academic research and practical applications, and focuses on the widest range of life skills.
	Section~\ref{sec:linkDomains} discusses how the topics and issues found within education extend to other domains such as workplace settings, medical personnel, therapy and everyday social and emotional skills. Sections~\ref{sec:summary} and \ref{sec:HCIsupport} then take an HCI perspective again, identifying the key topics and challenges across the existing programs, tying these to potential technology support, and suggesting a broader research agenda for HCI. This specifically builds on the detailed description of the approaches and strategies used to teach skills in SEL in education, linking them to particular examples of, and opportunities for, HCI research.

%\todo{Wolfgang's start of putting this section into free text.} HCI dealt with many related aspects already, building growing evidence that HCI can help in addressing some of the key challenges in teaching and supporting social skills. Still, support for teaching social and emotional skills was not addressed in a systematic way so far. There are several examples where HCI research aims directly at teaching (or influencing) social skills. Most examples are from the autism domain, where a number of studies on using technology to help autistic children learn particular life skills (often social skills) exist. In the recent special issue on autism in Personal and Ubiquitous Computing journal, Hayes et al. \cite{Hayes2012} point out the potential of novel computing technologies, including assistive technologies, social systems and sensing and context aware systems for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Porayska-Pomsta et al. \cite{Porayska-Pomsta2011} argue for the importance of interdisciplinarity, and also highlight the methodological challenges that delivering effective socio-cognitive intervention by means of technology presents. The methodological issues are also pointed out by Zarin et al. \cite{Zarin2011} who presented a table top interface aimed at strengthening the communication and social skills of children with ASD and down syndrome. Escobedo et al. \cite{Escobedo2012} conducted a field test of this kind of intervention and deployed a mobile augmented reality system based on a successful social skills curriculum in a school setting with autism and neurotypical students. The application was able to improve the quality and quantity of social interactions among students by facilitating the practise of social skills in real life situations.

% {{{ SEL for schools
\subsection{Social and emotional learning for schools}
\label{sec:reasons}
%We chose social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools as an examplary domain we review in detail and return to other domains in the next section. %which serves as the basis for a \rephrase{system} of goals, methods and building blocks that encompasses also other domains.
%We outline the reasons for this choice below: 
Social and emotional learning in education is a particularly interesting domain for several reasons, all suggesting that the field is most likely already matured, with a number of well-researched approaches.
 

First, skills taught in school based curricula are those that have been identified by psychologists and educators as crucial not only to development in childhood and teenage years, but more importantly as key for adult life \cite{Greenberg2010}.  In particular, it focuses on large span of ages (kindergarden to university) and virtually all social skills important in adult life. As such, it encompasses the goals of other life skills domains, which often take a more specific emphasis on particular social skills and consider various social skills to be already developed and available. % as shown in sections below.

Second, SEL has more than 20 years long history of peer-reviewed, evidence based programs. These have been already deployed to hundreds of thousands pupils. For example, \citeN{Durlak2011} reviews 213 programs encompasing more than 270000 students of all ages, with the interventions conducted over several years and federal programs support further uptake of such curricula in the US. Some studies have their effects tracked for even longer periods of time, as is the case for \citeN{Muennig2009} who have recently presented a 37-year follow-up results of a randomized controlled trial.  

Third, recent academic reviews map the evidence showing positive effects of SEL in randomised trials in improving academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Weare2011} and teaching social and emotional skills has been also shown to impact many other on problematic aspects of behaviour such as mental health promotion \cite{Adi et al 2007a}, violence prevention \cite{Mytton 2002,Adi2007b} conflict resolution \cite{Garrard and Lipsey, 2007} and bullying \cite{Vreeman and Carroll, 2007}.
%
%Lastly, the topic also gains increasing political support in the US and Europe, suggesting that social and emotional learning programs for schools might be soon \rephrase{common}. As such, SEL itself provides a novel design space for HCI that could have a strong impact on everyday life and direct real-world applications. 

 %Example of this might be the emphasis on communication skills in medical domains or workplace.

\subsection{Current status of SEL curricula in schools}

There is growing evidence that social and emotional skills are key to healthy development \cite{Weare2011,Adi2009a,Damon2006} as well as are connected to academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Caprara2000}. Unfortunately, many kids and young adults lack key social and emotional skills \cite{Foster2005},  %BlumLibbey-Durlak2011,
but the positive results highlighted below slow that it is also possible to teach these.
%
A number of curricula teaching such social and emotional skills are (commercially) available (see e.g., \cite{CASEL2003,CASEL2013} for a list of more than 75 selected curricula). Many are already deployed in schools, mainly in the US, e.g.,  \citeN{Foster2005} reports in a recent review of U.S. school practices that 59\% of schools already have in place some SEL curricula. %programs to address the development and support of childrens social and emotional competencies.


Several recent academic reviews map the evidence showing positive effects of SEL in randomised trials in improving academic performance \cite{Durlak2011,Greenberg2010,Weare2011}. %For example, Durlak et.~al.~ \cite{Durlak2011} calculated that the effect sizes from the more than 200 SEL programs interventions averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests, 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills, as well as 10\% decrease in classroom misbehaviour, with the effects lasting for at least 6 months after the intervention.
%
	 Teaching social and emotional skills has been also shown to impact many other on problematic aspects of behaviour such as mental health promotion \cite{Adi et al 2007a}, violence prevention \cite{Mytton 2002,Adi2007b} conflict resolution \cite{Garrard and Lipsey, 2007} and bullying \cite{Vreeman and Carroll, 2007}.

% {{{ Methodology
\subsection{Methodology}	
\label{sec:methodology}
This paper does not provide a systematic review of the SEL literature. Many such papers are already available (e.g., \cite{Durlak2011,Weare2011,Adi2009a,Greenberg2010,Elbertson2009,Payton2008}) and focus mainly on the measurable effects and long-term impacts of the curricula.
%
We approached the topic with a complementary, HCI perspective in mind, aiming to draw out processes, methods and topics commonly used within curricula, and identify the challenges the curricula designers currently face.

To this end, we analysed the contents of selected curricula, in addition to the references cited by the academic reviews above. Given the large number of available curricula and the varying level of quality (ref), we drew mainly on a set of curricula selected by 'Collaboratory for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning' (CASEL)\footnote{\url{http://casel.org/}}, which is a non-profit organisation supporting research and application of social and emotional learning in education, co-founded and ran by the leading figures in the academic field. 

In particular, we drew on two 'guides' published be CASEL, each reviewing a number of selected curricula. \citeN{CASEL2003} guide reviews 80 SEL programs selected through a rigorous procedure, highlighting 22 of these as particularly excellent. Each of the 80 programs is described, rated on 15 aspects and linked to academic literature evaluating its effects. The newer version of the guide, \citeN{CASEL2013}, focusses primarily on preschool and elementary school programs, recommending 23 programs. Out of these, 14 have been already included in the 2003 version, and 9 are new\footnote{These are 4Rs, Competent Kids, Incredible years, MindUP, OpenCircle, Raising healthy children, RULER, Too Good For Violence, and Tools of the Mind.}. 
%
We first carefully analysed the descriptions of all programs in both guides, and continued with more detailed examination of the programs highlighted in either version of the guide (i.e., 34 programs altogether\footnote{Eleven programs highlighted in CASEL 2013 guide were already selected in the 2003 edition.}). We also analysed academic literature available for each of these programs as referenced in the guides, as long as it was accessible through libraries of three major universities (66 academic articles altogether). We also analysed any available course materials and descriptions of the programs on the internet.

% {{{ Teaching methods in SEL for schools

%\vfill ~ \pagebreak
\subsection{Methods for teaching SEL in education -- procedural learning}
\label{sec:methods}
 
Social and emotional skills are highly complex abilities, strongly dependent on external inputs and context, and are often based on subconscious processing \cite{Ambady2010,Lieberman2000}. As such, social and emotional skills are mostly based on \emph{procedural} rather than declarative knowledge \cite[p.288]{kruglanski2007social}, which is also key aspect acknowledged by all curricula. In other words, although people often have intuitive knowledge on how to react, it is problematic to explicitly articulate the processing rules by which they came to these conclusions. Examples of similar dependency on procedural skills can be readily found also in other aspects of our life such as language use, where we know which form in our native language is correct but not necessarily why (``it sounds better''); or social cognition where, for example, people are very sensitive to correct proportions of human face, but are not able to correctly articulate even the most basic ones explicitly \cite{Lewicki1987}. 

Moreover, the key ability of most social and emotional skills is to be able to react accordingly even within `hot' moments, i.e., despite being overwhelmed with emotions or importance of the situation. During such moments, the ability of conscious, analytical thought is often diminished \cite{Wyman2010, leDoux1998}, again emphasising the need for learning skills on procedural basis.  Such strong emphasis on procedural learning is also one of the main differences of teaching social and emotional skills to other parts of education, which gives more emphasis on declarative learning. This is also the reason why most of the existing HCI work on computer supported learning looking to support learning in these aspects, is mostly out of the scope of this paper. 

%The key focus on procedural learning is highlighted also by the methods used for % importance of \emph{procedural} (instead of declarative)
%teaching for social skills courses. 
%In particular, we identified several general methods and approaches used across virtually all curricula.

The methods used to teach social and emotional skills reflect this emphasis on procedural learning. Curricula include extensive examples and opportunities for personal experience and practice. Curricula attempt to break the skills down into `digestable' bits, focusing first on simple model situations and exploring these by role play, and only then slowly building up to more complex situations. These situations are then preferably drawn from real-world issues the students commonly experience, or particular experiences of the class. Repeated practice, mostly with peers, is vital in every step of the process.%  or linked to a book, personal narative etc. 

Once a skill is mastered within the lesson, key emphasis is then on its \emph{transfer} out of the classroom into everyday contexts. Based on our reading of the literature, we argue that such transfer is something existing curricula struggle with most at the moment. Current approaches aim to support opportunities for the learners to practice their new skills also in real life situations outside of the classroom, but do not have many strategies to do so. Among the commonly used are methods to increase awareness and remind learners about their skills on the school grounds (e.g., posters around the school), attempts to enlist the help of their social networks outside of learning environment (e.g., letters to parents asking them to help reinforce the learning at home), as well as various home exercice for students. %As outlined in more detail in section~\ref{sec:HCIsupport}, this is one of the core aspects where HCI could contribute.
	
In summary, the curricula focus on procedural learning and aim to help children and teenagers to make the skills and concepts tangible, understandable, and support personal experience whenever possible. As such, emphasis is on repeated practice, often through role play, and on transfering the learnt skills into the everyday situations, outside of the classical training context. The next section gives specific examples of using these methods and describes in more detail the topics taught.

% {{{ Topics in SEL
\subsection{Topics taught in SEL}
\label{sec:blocks}

Whereas previous section focussed on methods and the general approaches taken to teach social and emotional skills (i.e., "how"), this section focuses on the content, i.e., "what" gets taught. %We aim to outline the commonalities among curricula in terms of the topics taught, the exercices/approaches to do so, and the order in which the topics are learned. % Similarly to above, we draw on thorough perusal of literature describing the twenty-three interventions selected as effective by \citeN{CASEL2013}; as well as other related literature.
%
To draw out the commonalities among curricula, we identified four overarching topics that appear consistently in most of the courses we reviewed. These are:  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item identifying and understanding emotions (own and of others);
	\item managing own emotions;
	\item communication and relationship skills;
	\item dealing with conflicts and problematic situations.
\end{enumerate}
 % Once mastered, these skills feed into the core competencies described in previous section, as shown at Figure~\ref{fig:strmap}.	

Each topic subsumes a number of simple situations or goals (e.g., being able to identify when becoming angry) and ways to train these (e.g., training children to notice physical changes in their bodies). 
Although the exact approach, terminology or exercises used by particular curricula can differ among each other, we saw a substantial amount of similarity in the focus and emphasis on these sets of skills across the literature.
Moreover, these topics depend on each other in a sequential manner. For example, the ability to identify and understand emotions is key for managing own emotions (without knowing about your emotions, one cannot control them), which is in turn needed for keeping relationships (taking the perspective of another and not jumping to conclusions) etc. As such, they are mostly taught in the order as shown at Figure~\ref{fig:depfoc}. 

We further describe each topic in a respective subsection below, illustrating the descriptions with examples of specific activities from selected curricula. Our aim is two fold: on one hand, to provide an initial 'feel' for how such skills are taught in this domain; as well as provide examples which can be used in later sections to tie some of the existing HCI research to the approached presented here.

\subsubsection{Identifying and understanding of emotions} 
	%\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}%

  %\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}%
The ability to identify and understand own and others' emotions is a precursor of most other social and emotional skills. Key goal is developing emotional awareness of learners, which is the ability to differenciate, name and notice subtle changes of emotions. Curricula aim to train a practice of internal reflection, leading to continuous exploration of how we and others feel. Emphasis is also on making the distiction between acknowledging a feeling, and acting upon that feeling/urge. 

In particular, some of the curricula build on language usage, and how language that affects our thinking processes. Various exercises focus on developing the ability to identify and name emotions in both oneself and others, helping learners to become more reflexive and self-aware. As an example, PATHS curriculum  includes physical ``Feeling Faces'' cards, which kids use to signal their current emotional state throughout the day \cite{Kam2004,Domitrovich2007}. Similarly,  RULER curriculum uses popular stories to exemplify particular emotions, or draw out distinctions among subtle variants of a specific one \cite{Reyes2012}. 
%
Other approach is to support self-reflexion by exploring and understanding how our bodies are affected by experiencing particular emotions. For an example, children are helped to recognize their own feelings by checking their bodies and faces for `tight' or relaxed muscles, frowns, smiles, and sensations in other parts of their bodies such as butterflies in their stomachs. Matching the facial expressions and body postures shown on cue cards helps the children to recognize the cues from their own bodies and associate a word with these feelings \cite{Webster-Stratton2004}. 
%		
Emotions of others are explored through the ways in which they affect the tone of voice, body language etc. This is often incorporated as a game, e.g., developing the 'detective skills' to find out how others feel.  Constant use of similar activities aims to help learners think more often about how they, and others, might feel in various situations. 

Curricula including content on identifying and understading emotions are listed in the footnote\footnote{Caring School Community, I can problem solve, Life Skills Training, PATHS, Peace Works, Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, 4Rs, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, Michigan Model for Health, MindUP, RULER, Social decision making, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 21 in total}}.


\subsubsection{Self-control strategies}
	%\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}%
  %\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}%
Self control and management of own emotions is a key aspect present virtually in all curricula\footnote{Life Skills Training, Lion's Quest, PATHS, Peace Works, Productive Conflict Resolution Program , Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RCCP, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, Teenage Health teaching Modules, 4Rs, Al's Pals, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, MindUP, Positive Action, RULER, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 24 in total}}. Techniques used to developed self control build on emotional awareness.%, aiming to teach strategies for managing strong emotions once they are recognised. 

Various strategies and exercises aim to help participants to relax and/or calm down once a strong feeling is recognised. These are often based on various physiological exercises such as muscles stretching and deep breathing techniques, or verbal labelling. Verbal labelling builds on psychology and neuroscience findings showing that the act of consciously labelling an emotion by name (rather than "just" being aware of it) facilitates higher cognitive control over the emotional state \cite{Greenberg2006,Reyes2012}. Exercises training explicit acknowledgement of emotions, as well as thinking about what could be its cause, are often used. 
Specific strategies for anger management are particularly common, often combining both verbal labelling and physical relaxation exercises. An example is the ``Turtle technique'' \cite{Robin1976}, which is still used in a number of curricula. In this technique, kids are taught to ``withdraw to their shell'' (by pulling their arms and legs close their body and closing their eyes) at specified occassions such as they feel increasingly angry. This is followed by relaxation phase, where specific muscle groups are tensed and released. Once this technique is mastered, children discuss and appropriate alternative strategies of dealing with stressful situations, now that they are able to consciously reflect and react to them.

\subsubsection{Communication skills}%Facilitating positive relationships},
		This set of activities focuses on building good communication skills and supporting positive interactions with others\footnote{While implicit in many others, this aspect is explicitly highlighted within the following curricula: Michigan Model for Comprehensive Scholl health Education, Peace Works, Open Circle, RCCP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Tribes, Al's Pals, The Incredible Years Series, MindUP, Positive Action, Steps to respect curricula. {\bf 13 in total.}}. The skills taught here aim at supporting respectful communication and thus implicitly, facilitating friendship relationships, ability to collaborate and avoiding conflicts that could otherwise occur through misunderstanding. 

		 Generally, emphasis is on teaching active listening, which is then used to facilitate teaching empathy. Other teaching strategies also focus on training of specific communication skills (e.g., giving and accepting compliments).
		Exercises include games to induce collaborative activities, practicing active listening, e.g., through listening to someone telling a story and then trying to rephrase it with as many details as possible; or disagreeing respectfully. These can include ways to subtly reframe the same contents into a form which is not threatening, such as in \citeN{ABER1998} where students are taught to acknowledge the potential mismatch between their and the other's perception of the situation (e.g., preferably saying "It seems to me you are not listening now", rather than ``Why aren't you listening to me!'').

	\subsubsection{Dealing with conflicts and problematic situations} 
		Problem solving strategies and conflict management are the last topic of most curricula\footnote{Michigan Model for Comprehensive Scholl health Education, PATHS, Peace Works, Productive Conflict Resolution Program, Quest (Violence Prevention Series), Open Circle, RCCP, RIPP, Responsive Classroom, Second Step, SOAR, Social Decision Making and Problem Solving Program, Tribes, 4Rs, Al's Pals, I Can Problem Solve, Competent Kids, The Incredible Years Series, Positive Action, Social decision making, Steps to respect, Too Good For Violence. {\bf 22 in total}}.  Violence prevention is commonly an important additional goal, as many of these curricula are designed also for schools and neighbourhoods with high prevalence of aggression and weapons. 
		
		
		Students are often taught particular structure of reaction to a problematic situation or a conflict.
%
Key aproach is to help students process situation on a cognitive level, despite the fact that conflicts tend to ignite strong emotions. For example, PATHS curriculum includes a ``semaphore'', where the sequence of red-yellow-green indicated the stop-think-proceed \cite{Kam2004,Domitrovich2007}. Such structured sequences always include and emphasise a goal setting and evaluation phase. Moreover, curricula aim to teach children and teenagers to recognise which conflicts might have arisen from misunderstanding, with perspective taking exercises being the key approach. An example are workshops focusing on win-win negotiation (e.g., RCCP) and providing suggested sequences for steps to take during disagreements (e.g., Incredible Years).

% {{{ Summary of SEL for education
\subsection{Summary of SEL for education}
We chose to describe the social and emotional learning in education in detail as:  (i) it has long history of research and high number of evidence-based curricula, described in academic literature; (ii) focuses on large span of ages and skills; and (iii) rigorous studies testing its positive effects exist. We also argue that due to these properties, it can provide an initial structure to encompass social and emotional skills training approaches also in other domains.  
	%very little literature on SEL for education exists in HCI, despite its high potential.
%
Based on an extensive review of the existing literature, we: 
\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Point to the {\bf five core competencies} describing the goal life skills which SEL programs aim to teach.% We argue that these are relevant also to other life skills domains and will show that in the next section. 
	\item Outline the methods used to teach these skills, mainly based on procedural learning. This involves focus on practice, need for feedback, and strong emphasis on supporting transfer of learnt skills into the real-world.
	\item Identify four topics, comprising key sets of strategies and tasks used in the curricula. This provides specific examples of how the content of the curricula looks like, and will allow us to tie it in with the challenges and opportunities for HCI in Section~\ref{sec:HCIsupport}.

% {{{ Workplace and business related
\subsection{Workplace and business related}

Focus on emotional and social skills teaching has a long history in the workplace, e.g.,  \cite{Bailey1983,Bailey1983a}, appearing under a wide range of labels such as interpersonal skills, soft-skills or, more recently, emotional intelligence. Social and emotional skills training appears both as a part of educational contexts such as MBA or undergraduate business students, but also later in the career, e.g., many companies offer soft-skills courses or coaching to their executives and increasingly also other staff. 
%
Academic literature shows positive effects of such training \cite{ArthurWinfred2003}, but the existing evidence is not as strong as for SEL in education. Some of the reasons are that training programs have often been developed on a purely commercial basis and outside of academic community, can be based on practice rather than pure scientific background, and detailed information about the contents is often not available due to competition among companies \cite{Walter2011,Clarke2006,Riggio2002}. 




\subsubsection*{Methods} Majority of courses follows similar strategies: role-play as a key approach to teaching the skills, together with discussion of fictional and real life cases, demonstrations and modeling. Emphasis is placed on \emph{procedural learning} and the opportunity to practice and automate the skills. Time-frames differ from a few hour long course to multi-day or even longer term learning (e.g., as in coaching). 

\subsubsection*{Topics} 
	Key focus is on developing aspects of \emph{emotional intelligence} (EI), which can be defined as ``the ability to carry out accurate reasoning focused on emotions and the ability to use emotions and emotional knowledge to enhance thought'' \cite{Mayer2008}. Such training might, for example, develop communication and cooperation skills, as well as increase self-awareness of the employees. 
	
	Specific teaching leadership programs are designed for executives, often aimed at relationship skills (such as conflict management and interviewing) and self-management (e.g., dealing with stress or time-planning and goal setting). Executives are often expected not only to learn these skills themselves, but also to be able to teach them to others later on. Coaching is often used as a way to help executives develop EI skills \cite{Bono2009}. It is inherently client based, with the goals depending on the situation, and emphasises honest feedback, supporting reflection and accepting responsibility for own decisions. 

\subsubsection*{Reviews} \citeN{ArthurWinfred2003} provides a general overview of effectiveness of training within organisations, including training of interpersonal skills, and discusses the effects of various training designs. \citeN{Mayer2008} gives a thorough review of emotional intelligence concept.  \citeN{Feldman2005} and \citeN{Bono2009} summarise the executive coaching practices and process, while \citeN{Carey2011} provides a rigorous review of academic coaching literature.

% {{{ Medical settings
\subsection{Medical settings}
Social skills such as communication skills or empathy are gaining importance in medical community \cite{Rider2006,Barth2011,Makoul2007,Kalet2004}. %As Brown \cite{Brown2008} puts it,  ``Over the last 20 years, the topic has raised from its status as a "nice to know" subject to that of a "need to know" skill set in modern medical education''. 
Three key areas are especially emphasised: (i) training of medical students during university \cite{Kalet2004}; (ii) support/courses for practicing doctors [ref?]; and (iii) focus on specialised groups of doctors and nurses, such as cancer care or end-of-life care, where specific skills related to empathy and communication are even more important (e.g., when giving bad news to patient) \cite{Tulsky2011}. Peer-reviewed evidence of effectivity is available for some of the interventions in this domain.  

\subsubsection*{Methods} Role play with peers or trained actors is emphasised \cite{Stepien2006,Stiefel2010,Kalet2004,Barth2011}, followed by facilitator or peer based feedback \cite{Rao2007}. Courses also include workshops, lectures, discussions of case studies. Many courses that aim at general communication skills include scripted exchanges or examples to practice on. 

\subsubsection*{Topics} 
		Key focus is on generic communication skills and supporting patient/clinitian interaction. Emphasis on both the ability to inquire for diagnosis related information and clear communication the results or suggestions (e.g., \cite{Kalet2004,Barth2011} for examples and review), as well as on techniques such as motivational interviewing \cite{Hettema2005}. 

		Empathy is understood as a key component of doctor/patient interactions \cite{Stepien2006}, and the training also often involves aspects such as sensitive responding to emotions from patients and improved understanding of patients psychosocial issues and concerns. Moreover, doctors might tend to block both own and patients' emotions during difficult moments (e.g., having to communicate critical diagnosis) and concentrate on the pragmatics without additional training, leading to negative consequences \cite{Barth2011}. Such situations are common especially within oncology and similar disciplines, but in lesser extent also other general practice. Focus on self-oriented emotional skills such as personal reflection, mindfulness or stress management is also increasingly emphasised \cite{Satterfield2007}. 
		Initial studies on including technology into the teaching process have been successful, e.g., \cite{Tulsky2011}.
	%	\item Additional focus on specific communication skills  such as breaking bad news for oncologists and \todo{...}.

\subsubsection*{Reviews} \citeN{Rao2007} presents a systematic review of interventions designed to enhance communication behaviours between patients and doctors, and \citeN{Barth2011} systematically reviews communication courses specialised for oncology personnel. Emotional skills training for medical students is reviewed by \cite{Satterfield2007}. \citeN{Pedersen2009} and \citeN{Stepien2006}  review training courses that aim to increase empathetic skills of students or practitioners.

% {{{ Key competencies
In this section we identify what goals that are common across the domains. More importantly, we then characterise the challenges present within most of the curricula, with particular emphasis on those that could be supported by technology.

\subsection{Framework of life skill goals}

Despite the wide range of curricula and approaches within them, there are a overreaching goals that most interventions have in common. A set of \emph{five core composite competencies} is widely accepted within the educational community \cite{Zins2007,Durlak2011,CASEL2003,CASEL2013}, as such a list of general goals shared by most of the existing curricula. We suggest that this list can also serve well as an initial  of systematising the goals across all of the life skills training domains reviewed above. 
%
We list these compentencies as per \citeN{Durlak2011}:


%\todo{Not a good place for this? .. where does this go?}
%In other words, they provide a good description of the goal state (what SEL aims to achieve), and 
%
% serving as the key overreaching social and emotional skills that SEL curricula teach and promote. 
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Self awareness: }
			The ability to accurately recognize ones emotions and thoughts and their influence on behavior. This includes accurately assessing ones strengths and limitations and possessing a well-grounded sense of confidence and optimism.
	\item {\bf Self-management: }
			 The ability to regulate ones emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations. This includes managing stress, controlling impulses, motivating oneself, and setting and working toward achieving personal and academic goals.
	\item {\bf Social awareness: }
			 The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures, to understand social and ethical norms for behavior, and to recognize family, school, and community resources and supports.
	\item {\bf Relationship skills: }
			The ability to establish and maintain healthy and rewarding relationships with diverse individuals and groups. This includes communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating, resisting inappropriate social pressure, negotiating conflict constructively, and seeking and offering help when needed.
	\item {\bf Responsible decision making: }
			The ability to make constructive and respectful choices about personal behavior and social interactions based on consideration of ethical standards, safety concerns, social norms, the realistic evaluation of consequences of various actions, and the well-being of self and others.

%\item \todo{not sure how to exactly describe the difference between the core competencies and the strategies/focal points from next section. Both are sets of skills.

%While these composite competencies describe well the complex, interrelated set of skills that SEL programs aim to teach and support, it is however not immediately apparent \emph{how} such composite skills could be taught; and which parts might be open to technology support.

%We aim identify the most commonly used activities and program components that were appearing consistently across many of the curricula.

\fi

The previous sections outlined that many courses teaching social and emotional skills exist and are widely deployed across the domains. Moreover, positive effects of such courses have been shown by peer-reviewed literature and various meta-analytic studies. This sections aims to identify the similarities across the domains in terms of topics, teaching process and challenges; and use these to point out the opportunities for technology-based support. In particular, we show that although the topics are too diverse to draw other than a quite general structure, there are striking similarities in the teaching process and challenges. The next section will then use these to provide the connections to HCI research and set the broader agenda.


\subsection*{Similarities in topics} Although the exact skills taught are specific to each domain, all share interest in supporting aspects of two broad categories of skills: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First are various aspects of {\bf emotional awareness}, including understanding and reflecting others' emotions as well as being aware and managing your own, dealing well with stress or controlling strong feelings. Examples can be the skills identified for SEL in education withing the first two topics, i.e., identifying emotions and self-control. Similarly, the core emotional intelligence exercises in business involve various facets emotional awareness, as do the personal reflection or stress management parts of medical courses. 
	\item Second category focusses on {\bf communication and relationship skills}, mostly building on emotional awareness. These can be the ability to emphasise, cooperate, take perspective and constructively deal with conflicting situations and hard decisions. In particular, the third and fourth topic identified for SEL are directly relevant, as is the emphasis on conflict management, leadership and interviewing in business settings, and patient interviewing or empathy training  in the medical domain. 
\end{enumerate} 

However, these categories are very broad and each domain is aiming to support slightly different aspects. It thus important to go deeper into the particular topics of the chosen domain to reach more detailed understanding of what aspects are emphasised, taught and how (similarly to what we attempted to outline for SEL in education).

go 

 
%\vfill ~ \pagebreak
\subsection*{Similarities in methods} In contrast, significant similarities in the teaching methods and process are used across all of the domains. We identify a set of learning principles below, with a specific focus on drawing out those aspects that could be enhanced by technology. 

The selected principles are not mutually exclusive and we chose to distinguish them here to highlight particular approaches/issues one can consider. In this sense, they allow us to outline more clearly how the social and emotional learning  ties in with (and could benefit from) HCI focus in the next sections. However, we want to emphasise that any system designed will draw on multiple if not all of these aspects, although perhaps focusing on some more than the others. 
	%In particular, we consider four challenges: supporting practice and feedback, embedding learning into everyday situations, creating engaging learning experiences, and utilising the facilitated nature of current skills teaching. 


\begin{figure}
  \centering
%	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/challenges}
	\caption{Diagram of the identified learning  principles and their relationships}
	\label{fig:sum-challenges}
\end{figure}

In particular, we draw out four learning principles:  %we draw out importance of practice, feedback, transfer and embedding of skills, and support for motivation and engagement as the four key principles: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  All curricula facilitate various ways to give the learners {\bf feedback} on their behaviour, mostly as social and emotional skills are very complex and challenging to track easily by the learners themselves without external facilitation. Feedback is mostly provided by the teacher/lector personally or by peers, often post-hoc and with varying level of detail.
	\item Emphasis on {\bf practice} and providing opportunities for personal experience and exploration of the skills is consistent across all of the reviewed domains and training approaches. Useful practice opportunities range from simple model examples that are role-played, to trying to practice skills in situations encountered in every day life.
	\item The core goal of all social and emotional skills training programs is to {\bf transfer and embed} the learned skills in everyday behaviour and real-world situations. The curricula approach this on one hand by including real-world examples and situations within the learning context -- e.g., asking students to recall and discuss particular experience they had; doctors and therapists analysing data from their own practice. %or asking a team to solve an existing, open problem they have (and analyse how well they did that afterwards).
%		However, this is still deeply rooted within the learning context. 
Additionally, they attempt to extend the learning context also outside of the lessons, for example by increasing awareness (e.g., posters placed around the building);  follow-up meetings to support recollection of what was learned, or asking learners' social network to help reinforce the learning and skills in between sessions.
	\item Supporting high {\bf motivation and engagement} of the learners plays a large role in all learning experiences and is acknowledged as a key aspect across all domains and curricula.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:sum-challenges} places all four principles into context: Feedback and practice play a central role in learning social and emotional skills, regardless whether within or outside of the learning contexts. Supporting transfer of learned skills by embedding parts of learning into everyday contexts and real-world situations is then one of the key goals in the training reviewed above. Additionally, learning experiences need to be engaging and motivating to be successful. Finally, we will argue later (Section~\ref{sec:facilitated}) how the {\bf facilitated learning} included of almost all the training programs poses a valuable setting for initial exploration of the social and emotional learning space. 

%\vfill ~ \pagebreak
\subsection*{Challenges for curricula designers}
%%%%%% rubbish starts :) %%%%
Curricula designers face several key challenges across the domains. These concern methods for providing (preferably real-time) feedback on learnt skills, ways of supporting learning experiences beyond the immediate scope of the facilitated training sessions.  

Providing timely feedback is difficult even within the facilitated training experience, especially as it is the trainer or peers who serve as the key source of feedback. This leads to receiving feedback in a post-hoc manner, mostly from unguided recollection of what was happening during the practice. Moreover, the trainer/students ratio often implies that learners get feedback mostly from their peers, who are not trained or particularly skilled in what is taught.  

It is even more challenging to design ways to support learners in extending the learning experiences beyond of the immediate teaching interactions, which is however key for sucessful transfer of skills into the real world. It is particularly difficult to instrument and support the practice of pupils outside of the learning lessons without technology in other ways than voluntary homework, or provide support to help learners embed the learnt skills into their everyday practices. Providing any feedback on behaviour outside of the teaching session is also problematic for the current curricula, leaving restrospective discussions based on recall as one of the few available options. 

By helping to address these challenges, HCI involvement could fundamentally augment and enhance the possibilities of existing courses, plausibly leading to novel and more effective learning and teaching methods. 

%While the courses across all domains have been shown to be effective, there are still challenges common to many of them. 

%One of the key ones is supporting and extending the learning experiences \emph{outside of the classroom}.  

%Moreover, we also see a high potential of technology to further support and augment existing teaching approaches within the classroom. We envision opportunities for support also for the remaining three teaching process principles described above, such as providing additional feedback opportunities (e.g., in real-time), environments and situations for practice (e.g., virtual reality or game environments), as well as helping to make the learning more engaging. The next section describes this in detail together with how doing so might also raise interesting novel questions and issues for HCI.

\label{sec:HCIsupport}
	%Previous section identified \emph{four key aspects and challenges} of life skills teaching that could be supported by technology. %as outlined in the previous section. 
This sections aims to show potential links among social and emotional learning courses and existing HCI interests and results. We exemplify these connections by providing representative examples of HCI work that ties in well to particular teaching strategies and curricula outlined earlier. In particular, we aim to rather draw out and inspire the potential connections, rather than provide a full review of \emph{all} related HCI work, which is out of scope of this paper (especially, as we argue below, the potential connections span most of ubiquitous computing, social signal processing, behavioural change literature etc.).  
%
\todo{Explicit explanation how the examples should be understood:} In other words, we do not suggest direct solutions to the problems/possibilities encountered within curricula, but aim to show how some of the HCI work is very relevant already, and how making the connections explicit could be beneficial for both HCI as well as SEL.  

The section is structured according to the four learning  principles identified above, as each principle points to somewhat different aspects within HCI. We further divide the discussion of each principle into subtopics according to the topics identified within SEL curricula (section \ref{sec:feedback} on supporting feedback) or according to the existing strands of research within HCI (sections on the remaining three principles). See Figure~\ref{fig:HCIsummary} for an overview.

% {{{ Feedback
\subsection{Feedback}
\label{sec:feedback}
	Given that many of the skills are quite complex and hard to track by the learners themselves, all curricula facilitate various ways to give feedback. These are currently based on trainers' instruction, peer feedback and evaluation, or encouradging personal post-hoc reflection. 
As such, there are explicit challenges and opportunities for supporting feedback outside of learning sessions as well as enhancing the feedback available within the sessions. Additionally, prior HCI research suggests that there is potential for novel, technology based types feedback altogether, such as those based on physiological signals or other sensed data. 
%
%		As the teacher personally (or peers) are the only ways of providing feedback in the current curricula so far, additional feedback systems based on technology could be useful to help participants receive ``more'' feedback, either on a more micro level or just more often. Such additional feedback opportunities would be particularly useful outside of training sessions (when the trainer or mentor is no longer available), but also during the sessions when there is often only one instructor giving feedback to many students.

%	We now outline related HCI work and how it could be linked to these challenges.

We argue that the focus on feedback opportunities in this space could be especially fruitful topic for HCI community, as HCI research has only recently started focusing and tracking many aspects important to skills learning such focus on emotion from affective computing, social signals processing, emphasis on reflection and reminiscence as well as the initial work into supporting therapy. These could then not only readily enhance or be incorporated into existing curricula, but, in doing so, raise intriguing challenges for HCI \rephrase{and address the "Tech looking for a problem" we have?}.

As feedback is closely tied with the content of what is taught, we structure this subsection according to the key topics across the domains as outlined above. We first focus on \emph{emotional awareness} (subsection \ref{sec:emaware}) and then on \emph{communication and relationship skills} (subsection \ref{sec:strategies}). %The third subsection discusses the specific focus on following \emph{structured ways of reacting} to particular situations, which is prevalent in school and medical domains curricula \todo{ -- may move to practice section}. %In doing so, we point to examples of related HCI research which illustrate the potential synergy:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item emotional awareness (\ref{sec:emaware})
%		\item self-control  (\ref{sec:selfcontrol})
%		\item communication skills (\ref{sec:strategies})%, e.g., active listening, correct communication patterns, non-verbal behaviour 
%		\item structured ways of reacting, e.g., following a sequence of steps to deal with a conflict situation (\ref{sec:structure})
%	\end{itemize}

\rephrase{We also focus mainly on ways to capture or compute things of interest and not on the various ways of providing feedback once we know what, as this has been extensively researched in HCI as well. For example, \citeN{Borner2013} reviews the use of ambient displays feedback in learning contexts.  }

% {{{ Emotional awareness
	\subsubsection{Emotional awareness}
	\label{sec:emaware}
	 Much work has been recently done in HCI around supporting reflection \cite{Fleck2010}, recognising and tracking emotions and helping people reach better awareness about their activities. Such research is on one hand driven by advances in sensor technologies leading tp affective computing systems and social signals processing in general (e.g., \cite{Sun2011,Pentland2008}), leading to systems automatically assessing variables of interest. Other work, however, looks at supporting personal reflection by providing users with additional data about their activities though other means, and aims to support their own reflection rather than providing system-based interpretation (e.g., \cite{Kalnikaite2010,Hook2008,Slovak2012}).
Such systems could, for example, fit well into the initial stages of curricula in schools, for example as a part of exercises aimed to teach children to reflect on, and label, their emotions; but also in a more advanced contexts such as a part of reflective exercises in bussiness social skills courses. 

\paragraph{Supporting reflection and awareness}
 For a more specific example, a number of paper focused on tracking and visualising emotional changes over the period of days, helping users to become more self-aware and draw out patterns that they wouldn't have noticed otherwise. This can be either on a more automatic, affective computing basis, as used by AffectAura \cite{McDuff2012}; or with more emphasis on the interpretation on the part of the user (e.g., Affective Diary work \cite{Stahl2008,Sengers2007,Hook2008}. 
% 
 Similarly, Subtle Stone \cite{Balaam2010} presents users with options to indicate their current emotion through an ambient, ambiguous visualisation, very closely resembling the Feeling Faces used in PATHS curriculum. However, the nature of technology would allow for enhancing this to be more than ``just'' a moment-to-moment reflection tool by tracking and facilitating reflection over time, providing an overview of class mood and similar; all of which might be useful additional information in some of the curricula. 

Other work has focused on a more in-the-moment self-awareness. Examples are  systems such as designed by \citeN{Moraveji2011} to support greater awareness of own breathing, helping the user to maintain calm and relaxed state; or mobile tracking systems exemplified by \citeN{Rabbi2011}. Such systems might be used either in a nearly unchanged form as a part of supporting breathing relaxation exercises taught across domains; or serve as inspiration for new systems aiming to reflect background awareness of other aspects trackable by technology.

%		\subsubsection{Self-control} 
%		\label{sec:selfcontrol}
		
	\paragraph{Managing own emotions} Self-control is the key emphasis in many of the curricula across domains. Specific focus is often given on impulse management, such as anger or accute stress, where the pivotal aspect is \emph{realising} that one is getting aroused %(or feels other strong emotion) 
	and then triggering the appropriate response, e.g., techniques for calming down. However, it is challenging to get feedback promptly when learning this. The recent advances within affective computing drawing on physiological signals to detect stress could be particularly useful here. 
	
	For example, \citeN{Bouchard2012} rigorous study shows how a short training based on a combination of physiological signals feedback and a computer game as a stimulus can help soldiers better manage their stress in other situations, reporting significantly better results than traditional techniques. Similarly, there are recent results suggesting the possibility to automatically track seisures \cite{Poh2012}, arousal increase in autists \cite{Picard2009}, or interruption detection \cite{Pan2011}, all outside of the lab and (close to) real-world settings. Additionally, much of the other social signals processing work bears promise to provide additional approaches to detecting emotional states such as anger or stress building on audio and video analyses techniques \cite{Vinciarelli2012} that might be well suited for tracking  within the classroom (or other enclosed spaces such as a meeting room). 

Such systems would fit well with the content many of the curricula across the domains, where the students are taught to observe and reflect on the changes felt in their bodies during (and at the beginning) of such episodes. Moreover, many of the sensors are wearable and are likely to become unobtrusive soon, suggesting the potential to support feedback outside of classroom and during everyday life. 

Other aspects of managing own emotions focus on keeping up motivation, postponing pleasurable experiences etc., each of which might have measurable correlates detectable by sensors or analysis of logged data, for example through similar techniques as the emotional awareness systems described above.

% {{{ Communication skills
	\subsubsection{Communication skills}
	\label{sec:strategies}
	Many curricula involve exercises to teach particular interaction styles and strategies. Prior work in HCI suggests ways in which technology might be able to support and enhance the feedback possibilities, with the potential to make the learning more effective. In particular, a number of papers show how relevant aspects of interaction are trackable in real-time, and how providing feedback on these can affect and change interaction in positive ways.
	
	For example, the Meeting Mediator system by \citeN{Kim2008} directly feeds back speaking behaviour of participants in a discussion. Such feedback lowers domination of individuals and helps achieve a more balanced discussion.  Similarly, \citeN{Pentland2008} shows techniques to track aspects such as influence or activity within the interaction and \citeN{Gatica-Perez2009} reviews other methods to analyse and track aspects of social interaction in small groups. Moreover, \citeN{DiMicco2007} discusses how increased awareness of parts of the interaction can affect and shape group dynamics. 
	There are also indices that even more subtler elements of interpersonal interaction can be addressed. For example, \citeN{Balaam2011} shows how feedback based on non-verbal behaviour can affect and increase feelings of rapport. Although \citeN{Balaam2011} used Wizard of Oz techniques to select the indicators, there are already several systems that aim to automise similar tracking \cite{Sun2011,Hagad2011}. Similarly, \citeN{Daily2010} uses physiological data to provide posteriori feedback on group discussion in classes, supporting improved reflection of the shared experience and empathy.  

These systems suggest that similar feedback could be useful for many aspects of the curricula, including active listening, constructive communication styles or perpective taking exercises.

% {{{ Practice
\subsection{Practice}

Majority of the reviewed curricula aimed to provide extensive opportunities to practice within and outside of lessons, using role-plays and model situations setups. Through these methods, the goal is to practice `proper' reactions and understanding of situations and challenges one can face in daily life. 
	
Existing HCI literature points to three areas which are directly relevant. First, the feedback opportunities from earlier section can directly extend the options to practice both within and outside of learning sessions. It is particularly using technology to support practice `in the wild'  that suggests high potential of, as well as opportunities and challenges for, ubiquitous computing based applications. Second, recent work on conversational/relational agents together with research on virtual spaces  points to novel, easily controllable and configurable environments allowing for practice in a a wide range of possible model situations and topics. Third, the rising interest in serious games could also bring opportunities for further practice of particular skills.

\subsubsection{Bringing practice opportunities "into the wild"} 
One of the key problems with practice "in the wild" in the existing curricula is the difficulty in providing learners with sufficient feedback and support. However, many of the feedback options described above have been, or at least have the potential, to be deployed practical real-world use, thus enhancing the possibilities available to social and emotional curricula. 

As an example, many of the systems supporting reflection have been already developed with real-world use in mind (e.g., AffectAura \cite{McDuff2012}, SubleStone \cite{Balaam2011}  Affective Diary \cite{Stahl2008}).  Initial work has also deployed analogous principles to support emotional awareness training  \cite{Matthews2011}, or tracking of social skills exercices \cite{DeSa2010} for therapy clients, drawing on the increasing power and ubiquity of mobile phones. 
%
Prior work also shows how technology can help shape and support practice particular interaction stategies outside of the class. For example, the MOSOCO project \cite{Escobedo2012,Tentori2010} shows how mobile phones can help autistic kids practice their social skills outside of lessons, and how the system can help elicit feedback from their peers. \rephrase{Such systems fit well with the emphasis on structured ways of reacting existing in medical/education domains.}

Feedback on many of the interactional aspects, that are of interest to social and emotional skills teaching, could be deployed in the wild. For example, systems such as Meeting Mediator \cite{Kim2008} or those described by \citeN{Pentland2008} could be easily adjusted to provide information on real-world meetings. Similarly, existing research suggests that some of the systems based on physiological signals could be also applicable outside of the laboratory or teaching contexts, despite the increased noise such sitations bring (e.g., \cite{Pan2011}). 
%
\todo{Add pointers systems such as \cite{Tulsky2011}, which support post-hoc feedback on real-world practices, by recording and then annotating? In some way, it fits into reflection, but at the same time, it includes getting new feedback, e.g, from teacher or peers. The good thing is that is also comes from medical domain, i.e., not school education.}

We argue that develping technology to support feedback and practice in the wild would highly benefit existing social and emotional learning programs, regardless of the domain, as it clearly addresses one of the key issues such curricula face. It would, however, also bring crucial challenges to HCI research, requiring systems that are robust enough to be applied in real-world settings. 


\subsubsection{Novel environments for practice}

Curricula across the board include a large number of role-play or modelling examples, allowing the learners to test the new skills in a safe situation. Technology brings many novel environments that are especially well suited for such role-play and practice. 

First example is the recent interest in serious games, with existing research strongly suggesting that complex concepts can be addressed. For example, \citeN{Coyle2011} shows how a specially designed game can enhance and positively augment cognitive behaviroual therapy, especially for teenage patients. Similarly, prior research has looked at the possibilities of novel interfaces such as multi-touch tabletops to augment therapy with autistic children, including aspects of cooperation \cite{Piper2006} or communication skills \cite{Zarin2011}. Moreover, there is initial evidence that similar serious games could also help people from the non-clinical populations. For example, \citeN{Hailpern2011} designed a game that helps relatives and friends of patients with Aphasia to increase awareness and understanding of teh aphasia disorder, and how it must feel for the patients themselves; and \citeN{Rusch2012} aimed to faciliating a similar understanding of depression. Similarly, \citeN{Rubin-Vaughan2011} developed and deployed a curriculum consisting a series of games that help children practice their social skills such as perspective taking, with specific focus on bullying prevention exercices. 

Other work focusses on re-appropriating existing games for learning contexts.For example, \citeN{Bouchard2012} re-uses and enhances a modern game to provide an environment for stress management training of soldiers. Similarly, \citeN{Gonzalez-Gonzalez2012} discusses how specific use of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMOPRG) can foster learning of social skills. For a recent review of the impact of games on skills learning see \cite{Connolly2012}.

Altogether, the above work suggests that games could help 
with many emotional and social skills, including aspects such as perspective taking or empathy, active listening, and exploring effects of various options one can take in an interaction. \medskip

Second extensive stand of HCI research focuses on augmented and virtual reality environments. 
%
Virtual reality has been successfully used in therapy to help people control social as well as other phobias (e.g., \cite{Romano2005}), or reduce physical pain \cite{Gromala2011}. The immersion into the simulated situation was the key part. 
%
Moreover, an increasing number of papers draw on \citeN{Bailenson2008} and explore how changing aspects of interaction in virtual reality affects learning or behavioural change. For example, \citeN{Fox2009} suggests that making feedback of user's actions more immediate and visible (e.g., the character gets literally slimmer when exercising) can increase the persuasive impacts also in the real-world (e.g., more exercise in the voluntary phase of the study); or experiencing a ``superpower'' within virtual reality can leads to measurable increases in prosocial behaviour in the real-world \cite{Rosenberg2013}. 
%
\todo{Additionally, augmented reality environments have been also used in educational settings, although mainly for cognitive rather than social or emotional skills learning, see \citeN{Wu2012} for a review.}

\todo{Connected research on embodied agents, with initial work on using these to support learning of particular skills -- e.g., negotiation in \citeN{Core2006}. Much work also on creating such virtual agents that can elicit feelings of empathy or support [some of the CHI nursing agents work?]; including work showing how making the agent mirror user's own non-verbal behaviour can increase perceived liking and persuasiveness.} 


%When "turned around" (e.g., emphasising your non-verbal gestures and body position by changes in an avatar you are interacting with) it is possible that these could be reappropriated for learning purposes. 


Social and emotional learning curricula could especially benefit from VR or augmented reality systems given the potential to simulate situation that be difficult or impossible to stage in real-life; even more so in combination with the gaming and embodied agents elements described above (as VR seems to intensify the immersion).

		\item Work on online support communities 
		\item Must be a lot around Facebook and other stuff 
		\item\todo{still under work ... }
		\subsubsection{Situated social support} The power of support networks to influence behavior has been emphasized by Fogg, who points out that social facilitation, i.e. the use of technology to facilitate connections between people, is one of the most powerful persuasive strategies \cite{Fogg2006}. This has been expanded further by Oinas-Kukkonen et al. \cite{Oinas-Kukkonen2009}, who list social support as a design principle for persuasive systems. They divide this principle into several sub-categories including competition, social comparison and cooperation, all of which could be leveraged in the design of systems that aim to embed social skills learning into people's everyday live. Based on a grounded theory analysis of Facebook as an existing example of an online social network, Weiksner et al. \cite{Weiksner2008} identified six design patterns for behavior change. While some of them are similar to the general principles laid out  by Oinas-Kukkonen et al., and patterns like deception should be ruled out in the teaching of social skills for ethical reasons, the patterns provoke and retaliate and self expression might potentially  be  useful additions to the repertoire for the design of systems utilizing support networks. 

		The principles outlined above have already been successfully utilized in systems for behavior change in various areas, with most studies conducted in sustainability and energy conservation and health and well being. The game Power Agent \cite{Gustafsson2009} is a particularly salient example in the latter area, since it uses social facilitation, particularly cooperation (with family members and peers) and competition (with other teams) and aims to facilitate learning of energy saving behaviors in a game setting. The game uses mobile phones as a platform and incorporates actual energy usage data into the gameplay, thus providing feedback about the effect of their actions and thus real world relevance to the users. The BinCam \cite{Thieme2012b}  is another system that promotes sustainability by leveraging social influence, in this case mediated via a social network, to foster reflection and behavior change regarding waste and recycling. Again, actual input regarding the issue at hand, in this case pictures of people's garbage, was combined with an application tied into the users' social network in order to support the desired target behaviors. 

		In the area of health and well being, the use of games based on social competition to influence people to become more physically active can be exemplified by FishnSteps \cite{Lin2006}. This game connects different users and uses a fish bowl metaphor with fish size changing based on the daily step counts of users, and fish of  users also present in the fish bowls of other user, thus enablng comparison and competition. Gasser et al. \cite{Gasser2006} also use social facilitation to support healthy nutrition and activity, using both mobile phones and a pc based application. 

		A commonality of these approaches is the integration of contextual data (e.g. from sensors) into applications utilizing support networks to influence behavior. This integration helps to better embed them into the users everyday life and have the desired impact. Social skills teaching similarly might  benefit from combing sensor data about user behavior, physiological states and context with applications utilizing support networks in order to allow continuous learning outside the classroom while still maintaining connections to the student's peer group.
		\subsubsection{Ambient and ubiquitous persuasion}
Ambient and ubiquitous technologies \cite{Weiser1995} can be seamlessly integrated into different contexts and environments and thus constitute a promising approach towards embedding social skills learning into peoples' everyday lives. Ambient displays integrate digital information into the physical environment  \cite{Wisneski1998} and can serve as subtle cues for facilitating awareness \cite{Reitberger2011}. Going beyond practise on an one-off basis and under specific circumstances, ambient systems can support learning over an extended period of time by sensing relevant information and feeding it back to the learner in a contextually adequate way. This kind of implicit interaction does not rely on any explicit actions of the user \cite{Schmidt2005} and thus could be utilized in longer term interventions without too much additional effort   Ambient persuasive displays, such as perFrames \cite{Obermair2008} and \cite{Tan2013} that can be used to give feedback about a user's posture and corresponding emotional states could support self reflexion and the recognition of feelings similarly to the cue card based approach in the Incredible Years Curriculum laid out in section 2.3.1.  
Furthermore, ambient systems can be used for tracking user behaviors over extended time periods in order to help to reveal previously hidden aspects and discover emerging patterns. In the area of sustainability, electricity \cite{Gustafsson2005} or water consumption \cite{Kuznetsov2010} was tracked and displayed to users in order to encourage conserving these resources.  Mobile devices and sensors can also be used to continuously track personal information \cite{Li2010} such as  physical activity data  \cite{Lin2006} to facilitate ongoing awareness and promote e.g. healthier habits.  Similarly, ubicomp technologies can be used to make domestic activities such as TV consumption and household chores \cite{Reitberger2013} more visible with situated and ambient displays and can foster reflection and renegotiation of such activities . Applied to social skills, ubiquitous sensors could implicitly track  quantitative (e.g. number and duration of conflicts) and qualitative (e.g. affective states during conversations)  factors related to social interaction over time and provide feedback to individual users to enable exploration and monitor their own progress, but also to teachers to give them a more holistic picture of their students that includes relevant aspects from their lives outside the formal teaching settings.

	\item Related HCI literature:
	\subsubsection{Feedback and rewards} There are several mechanisms to foster continuous engagement and motivation, with feedback, as discussed above, and rewards being amongst the most commonly used ones. Oinas-Kukkonen et al. see rewards as part of the broader category of dialogue support which also includes the similar design principle of praise. The principle of rewards works by giving credit to the users for performing the target behavior. Consolvo et al.  \cite{Consolvo2008}  for example do this by using a garden metaphor in a mobile app, where new flowers are growing whenever the users perform a fitness activity, so the more active the user is, the more beautiful the grade becomes. Virtual rewards as part of a game to motivate physical activity in younger players have been shown to increase the amount of activity performed by the players \cite{Berkovsky2012}. 
	\subsubsection {Gamification and gameful design} : Over the last years, there have been numerous examples of  applications and services that aim to influence users' towards a desired behavior using a persuasive approach often summarized as gamification or gameful design \cite{Deterding2011} \cite{McGonigal2011}.  Gamification works by integrating game mechanics like rewards, scores and points into real life activities.  Applications in this area e.g. aim to influence users towards becoming more fit, e.g. via activity tracking sensors  coupled with gamified services such as  Fitbit (http://www.fitbit.com) and Nike+ (http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/), to loose weight  (Withings) or to improve people's sleep (Zeo). Superbetter https://www.superbetter.com/ is an example of a game that particularly demonstrates the potential of this approach towards the learning of skills. This game aims to help players to increase their personal resilience by relying on game mechanics like quests, bad guys, and power-ups to engage players into sound scientifically proven exercises that help them to e.g. raise their mental or social resilience or improve their social connections or their mood. In a similar way, selected exercises from the basic building blocks of social skills learning could be embedded into gamified services that would augment the classroom based learning or even provide a form of social skills learning for people without access to regular courses. todo{ elaborate example}

\subsection{Facilitated learning -- valuable design space}
\label{sec:facilitated}
Majority of activities and learning aspect in all courses consist of \emph{facilitated learning}, regardless of the domain. We argue below that this points to an interesting design space in which novel technologies can be developed, marrying the value of direct application into and testing within real-world scenarios, with the possibility to do so within well constrained and manageble environment.  Whereas one of the key HCI contributions to social emotional learning courses could be extending the learning support \emph{beyond} classrooms and directly facilitated learning, developing systems for the such facilitated contexts can be a good first step, both in terms of testing the technology, as well as being directly useful to the teaching process. 



%			\item Follow up on the framing suggested for the rejected CHI workshop... ``Taking advantage of facilitated skills training: Life skills are often trained in formal courses.'' 

In particular, the learning sessions typically take place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present.  Moreover, the training experiences have a particular quality of being real and not-so-real at the same time. As reviewed above, it often involves participants practicing and trying things out in a safe place (e.g., through role play), where potential failures in interaction are actually a valuable basis for reflection and learning, and the expert trainer can immediately assist if problems appear. Such contexts also provide opportunities to support the learning on various levels, such as systems supporting facilitators expert role, as well as directly supporting the individual learners. 

Moreover, such controlled training space eases the generation of databases and corpuses of training data for automated approaches and allows for easier initial technology deployment than less controlled settings, while still supporting the "real" learning process (i.e., not an \rephrase{instrumented} laboratory task).

Whereas existing HCI work on teaching social and emotional skills has been mostly fragmented, often in form of single studies, with little follow-up or elaboration, the structure inherent in SEL curricula might promote more systematic research, higher comparability of and building on existing studies, and lead to highly successful, real-world applications. 
%
For example, the goals of social and emotional skills learning are complementary with existing HCI research that focuses supporting, enhancement and automatic analysis of social interaction, suggesting novel and well-motivated real-world applications for much of social signal processing and related research. 
%
Moreover, the topic of SEL within education also gains increasing political support in the US and Europe \todo{refs}, suggesting that social and emotional learning programs for schools might be soon included in most schools. The situation is similar also for the other domains, with SEL programs already flourishing in business and being on the rise within the medical domain. Overall, SEL provides a novel design space for HCI that could have a strong, positive impact on everyday life of a large population. 

More generally, training contexts such as the courses described here are an interesting design space in and of themselves as they could provide a valuable initial context in which to consider the design of other novel systems supporting life skills teaching and long-term development. Such training contexts keep all the \rephrase{positives} described in the Facilitated learning section \ref{sec:facilitated}. It also leaves open opportunities for technologies (and practice situations) that could not be applied in everyday settings for various reasons, such as simulating situations and interactions that are potentially dangerous or emotionally challenging.


	%\item Of interest for HCI is also that most of the curricula take training of the teachers very seriously, suggesting another potential settings where novel technology could be utilised and be very useful.


% {{{ Challenges for HCI
\subsection{Challenges for HCI }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \todo{key questions we need could look at: } e.g., what are the limits and potential of current social signal processing in terms of tracking such skils? Are they applicable in real-world use? etc. 

		Behavioural change application outside of energy consumption, well-being? 
		\item while there is a broad potential for application within the existing curricula and courses, doing so will require robust technology and cost-efficiency aspects, especially if one aims for a wider deployment. 
		\item How do we deal with the need for interdisciplinarity, as identified by \citeN{Porayska-Pomsta2011} or \citeN{Coyle2007}. \rephrase{Emphasise the need for co-development with the practitioners. }
		\item Real systems will need to combine most of the challenge categories above -- example of MOSOCO, which helps receive peer feedback, aims to support practice in the wild, and keep engagement through gamifying the situations (earning stars, comparison etc.). 
%		\item Successful examples of autism related systems ==> how will similar approaches extend to NT conditions, where most of the processes taught are much less structured, harder to track, and even specify?
	\end{itemize}
% }}}

	%Moreover, funding schemes supporting use of SEL curricula in schools exist in the US [\rephrase{can use the links from earlier version, e.g., US National Research Council}]. In addition, several governmental or non-governmental agencies compiled reviews and ratings of available curricula, to ease decision making process for schools. These include \todo{CASEL, Blueprints for Violence, the UK reviews, and others}.

While practice and feedback are central to all approaches to teaching social skills, there are also many other dimensions along which one could distinguish. In particular, practice can take: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item facilitated teaching vs. self-maintained
		\item within the classroom/teaching context vs. outside/everyday settings
		\item getting feedback from a trained teacher vs. peers/family/automated system
	\end{enumerate}
	The key challenge recognised in life skills training is supporting {\bf transfer of skills} from the lessons into real-world settings and everyday interactions.



 Based on the literature reviewed above, we identify {\bf four aspects} that are crucial for most of the curricula and each help towards the goal of learning and tranfering life skills. The next four subsection then relate existing HCI literature to these aspects. We will mainly draw on the SEL in education literature to provide specific examples (as it had been described in most detail). 
	%Thus, current skills training curricula are based on procedural learning. 
	
\begin{enumerate}
\item First is emphasis on {\bf feedback} mainly as the skills to be taught are challenging to track easily by the learners themselves. Many life skills are based on social and emotional aspects (e.g., emotional awareness or self-control) -- we will draw out later how recent advances in sensing technology such as affective computing [refs] or social signals processing [refs] could be useful in these aspects. 

\item Second aspect is supporting and facilitating enough {\bf practice}. As life skills are taught through procedural learning [ref?], practice is an inherent part of practically all training approaches, often including role play. In combination with novel feedback technologies, HCI could help extend the possibilities of practice beyond the classroom or provide novel environments in which safe practice is possible. Similarly, to \citeN{Coyle2011}, these environments can build gaming research including multiplayer online worlds, virtual reality and it's existing use in therapy [ref] etc.

\item Third, {\bf embedding activities} outside of the lessons contexts, which helps to hook the learning activities (both as a process as well as the outcomes) into daily life. \todo{needs to be elaborated on -- waiting for Wolfgang to do his bit on the related section below}. %\rephrase{Examples through social networks both online and offline?}

\item Fourth, generally {\bf engagement and motivation} are needed for the lessons to be effective, especially if practice outside of the learning contexts is required. HCI has proven to be quite effective in this in various domains aiming both at adults and children, e.g., behavioural change, cCBT, serious gaming, which suggests similar effects might be useful in life skills courses more widely. 

\end{enumerate}

\todo{This is core argument of the paper ... do we need to be more specific about how these aspects got chosen, or are the arguments in the subsections below sufficient? } \todo{Also point out that}... g., it is likely that applications will at the same time provide feedback, embedded in a serious game to keep engagement and motivation high, and by doing so allow for additional practice. 

%	We identified four key aspects that could be supported by technology:
%		\item training requires extensive {\bf practice}, preferably both during the %lessons as well as outside of them;
%		\item practice needs combination with sufficient {\bf feedback} on own %behaviour, (which often comes from external source such as the trainer);
%		\item to help embed and transfer the skills into everyday life, many %programs set up various {\bf support networks} that aim to extend the training %context to aspects of everyday life; 
%		\item learning social skills is difficult -- {\bf engagement and motivation} %are key aspects for each of the presented curricula. 
%	\end{itemize} 
\medskip
Moreover, most courses in all domains are based on \emph{facilitated learning}, i.e., situation when a small number of instructors leads a potentially high number of students. The sessions typically take place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present. Section~\ref{sec:facilitated} outlines how such training contexts are an interesting design space in and of themselves; as they could provide a valuable initial context in which to consider the design of new systems supporting life skills teaching and long-term development, as well as what opportunities are opened in this context for use of technology.

\subsection{Similarities -- needs and challenges }

\begin{itemize}
	\item We first draw out some initial similarities between all of the areas, among other things to guide the review of HCI literature as well as support the reader in easier understanding how might HCI support such courses.
	\item While we will reference some of the relevant papers, better justification comes in the following sections. 


	\item  As mentioned before, all of the domains mentioned above consider life skills teachable [e.g., refs to reviews?] and many strategies are available. 

	\item Across the areas there is similar emphasis on \emph{facilitated training}, including \emph{support for reflection and awareness} and 
    many life skills taught in facilitated courses
    Training often takes place indoors, involving a mix of lectures and hands-on experiences, likely with an expert trainer/coach present. 
    Moreover, supporting the training experience has a particular quality of being real and not-so-real at the same time. It often involves participants trying things out in a safe place (e.g., through role play), where potential failures are actually a valuable basis for reflection and learning.
    This opens a new interesting design space and intriguing questions on how could these particular characteristics ease or help development and deployment of new tech?

%{{{ Introduction
\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Behaviour change is a now a well established sub-field of HCI. 
	
	\item The efforts so far focused mainly on aspects such as supporting sustainable energy consumption and healthy behaviour, developing effective interventions in both. 
	
	\item In this paper, we would like to suggest that there are also other, similarly important areas that are (i) addressable by current or emerging technologies in HCI; (ii) were mostly ignored by the HCI community so far. 
	
	\item In particular, we argue that it is also possible to \rephrase{support and teach social skills} \forGer{-- how to frame it here? Strongest claim possible (but not too complex:) ... aim to claim SEL and medical as examples of  more general social skills training possible? Or is it enough to focus on them specifically?}. \todo{One sentence emphasising how extensive literature shows that social skills can be taught and learned (without details, just a heads-up for the evidence that comes a little later.}
	
	\item In this paper, we focus specifically on \rephrase{programs} supporting development of social skills for children and medical personnel as (i) \todo{social skills are very important here for "this-well-chosen-and-impressive-but-still-succinct-set-of-reasons"}; (ii) an area addressed by long-term research in education and psychology, with a wide range of courses developed, successfully deployed in real-world settings, and proved effective in controlled trials.\rephrase{ For example, \citet{Durlak2011} reports in recent meta-review of 213 school based programs (encompassing more than 270 000 students!) that such programs are effective and  lead to increases in academic performance, lowered aggression  problematic behaviour etc.. \todo{add the "Kids taking part in some of the programs showed an increase of 11-17 percentile points when compared to control group.}}. \todo{Similar example for medical?}
	
	\item Interestingly, only very little technology is used in such courses so far (e.g., only a videocamera to record and analyse an interaction). 

	\item However, \forGer{our analysis shows that?} these programs are often build on similar core concepts to those already addressed by HCI research on behaviour change, suggesting \rephrase{that HCI might help improve programs effectiveness and solve some of the problems that still remain to be addressed}. In particular, \todo{Bring in the main categories of interest we will use later on, to orient the reader to the similarities. Just a placeholder list for now: supporting reflection of own actions, inner emotional state, building habits, and facilitating self-control...  Perhaps a short explicit list linking this to HCI (affective/ubiquitous computing etc.), for the not-so-quick-or-well-read reader?}.

	\item  \rephrase{In this paper, we want to introduce the topic of social skills support into HCI and also aim to suggest how combining emerging technologies together with techniques used in other areas of HCI (such as behaviour change) could help such programs become more efficient. \forGer{How to properly frame the following: I want to spell out that our main goal is to inform HCi that this domain exists, and show why this could not only be a good place to apply knowledge already present in HCI, but also facilitate new interesting questions and approaches.} \todo{Should we argue here how it also connects to the "HCI for human values" etc. approaches?}}

	\item The main contribution of this paper is \todo{reframe per above -- connecting the literature from psychology and educational research on teaching social skills to HCI tools and techniques, opening new areas of interest (teaching social skills as a part of behavioural change direction), providing links to help other HCI researchers to get into the topic quickly? }
	\medskip 

	\item In the rest of this article, we first argue why social skills teaching is an important topic worthy of attention, and provide arguments showing that it can be successfully taught/learned/influenced in various ways. We then review related literature in HCI and related fields. We follow with a more detailed examination of various social and emotional skills programs in medical and educational domains, drawing out common core aspects and/or techniques that, as we argue, could be supported by technology and techniques already existing in HCI. \todo{The technology $\leftrightarrow$ techniques grid?.} We end with pointers to core literature, hoping to kick-start HCI researchers interested to pursue this topic.

%{{{ Social skills matter; and can be taught
\section{Social skills matter; and can be taught}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In this section, we want to argue several points: (i) social skills are important for many aspects of our life and well-being; (ii) there are several domains where an extensive amount of research on how to teach relevant social skills  exists and provides strong arguments why teaching social skills there is needed; (iii) present evidence showing that social skills training can work and have positive, long-term effects. 

	\rephrase{Further sections then show how HCI could be included to enhance possibilities and effectivity of such programs. }
	\item Generally, the concept of social skills span wide range of activities and aspects. In this paper, we chose to focus on two areas, where particular social skills are highly important -- first looks at improving social skills of children in primary/secondary schools; the other at professionals in medical services such as doctors and nurses. We chose these two areas as \todo{both address aspects of significant importance for society and come with a long history of research as well as clinical trials of developed programs. They are also sufficiently different to serve as good examples of the wide range of social skills that can be addressed and taught, but also can point to common concepts shared by such programs.... and similar yaddy yaddy da} 

	\item However, other domains can be addressed in further work,  \todo{e.g., coaching, work-place related soft-skills, etc.} 
	... as social skills are extremely important for nearly all aspects of our lives. \todo{Pull some general blah from a few papers, I expect it will come up while doing reading for other sections anyway... try to keep it short and use specific positive outcomes of social skills? Can maybe use autism as a negative example (i.e., what problems await if one lacks social skills)? I guess the last Golemans' book could be useful for some arguments/quotes. }
	
	\forGer{The end of the para does not fit all that well -- it is moved from elsewhere and I didn't want to lose it completely as something similar should be included to support our claim that also other social skills training programs outside the two areas we outline can be interesting as well. }

	\item The next two subsections revisit arguments for the importance of social skills in more detail, each focussing mainly on the particular social skills needed in the one of the two domains outlined above. We review evidence showing that (i) various programs developed to teach social skills in these domains exist; (ii) have been already widely deployed; (iii) and proved to be effective in both teaching new social skills to participants as well as \rephrase{facilitating other positive changes brought forth by the new social skills abilities}. 

\todo{I decided to keep "motivation+evidence of positive effect" together and divide the section per topic, i.e., school, then medical. School lit is much stronger than the medical one, so it probably makes sense to make it go first as a whole (and persuade the reader properly), and then say something like "similarly to above, research in medical domain also addresses ... " and just look at the differences}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{School related programs} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \forGer{Relate development of social skills to mental well-being and problematic behaviour -- thus motivating it} Development of social skills is crutial to mental health, especially for those at risk. School is an important place that helps or hinders such development. Greenberg and others use the language of school-based prevention ... maybe a good term to use as well? Example quotes:


	\qq{Durlak2011}{Extensive developmental research indicates that effective mastery of social-emotional competencies is associated with greater well-being and better school performance whereas the failure to achieve competence in these areas can lead to a variety of personal, social, and academic difficulties (Eisenberg, 2006; Guerra \& Bradshaw, 2008; Masten \& Coatsworth, 1998; Weissberg \& Greenberg, 1998).}

	\qq{NICE review -- Adi2009a}{The Mental Health Foundation (2000) has suggested that children who are mentally healthy will have the ability to: - Develop psychologically, emotionally, creatively, intellectually and spiritually - Initiate, develop and sustain mutually satisfying interpersonal relationships - Use and enjoy solitude - Become aware of others and empathise with them - Play and learn - Develop a sense of right and wrong - Resolve (face) problems and setbacks and learn from them.} .. and continues ... \qq{NICE review -- Adi2009a}{Most of those writing on positive mental health agree on the centrality of positive interpersonal relationships. In the literature relating to children, the concept of emotional intelligence (also called emotional literacy) is often cited (Weare 2000). This relates to the capacity for emotional awareness, emotional regulation, the use of emotional insight in interpersonal negotiations and empathy. (Salovey 1990, Sarni 1997) and is therefore the key to the establishment and maintenance of healthy relationships.}

\qq{Durlak2011}{Many correlational and longitudinal studies have documented connections between social- emotional variables and academic performance (e.g., Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, Bandura, \& Zimbardo, 2000; Wang et al., 1997)}

    


	\item \forGer{Follow by arguing that problems related to social and emotional skills are actually existing in many schools:} \qq{Foster2005}{Nearly three quarters (73 percent) of the schools reported that social, interpersonal, or family problems were the most frequent mental health problems for both male and female students. (p. 1).}  ...[follows with] ... \qq{Foster2005}{The problem category that schools reported most frequently as a top mental health issue was social, interpersonal, or family problems. This problem was also most frequently reported to consume the most resources, followed by aggression or disruptive behavior and behavioral problems associated with neurological disorders. (p. 24)} (Foster2005 is a national survey of mental health services in a representative sample of the approximately 83,000 public elementary, middle, and high schools and their associated school districts in the United States.)

	\qq{Durlak2011}{Unfortunately, many students lack social-emotional competencies and become less connected to school as they progress from elementary to middle to high school, and this lack of connection negatively affects their academic performance, behavior, and health (Blum \& Libbey, 2004).}

	\qq{Durlak2011}{In a national sample of 148,189 sixth to twelth graders, only 29\%-45\% of surveyed students reported that they had social competencies such as empathy, decision making, and conflict resolution skills, and only 29\% indicated that their school provided a caring, encouraging environment (Benson, 2006). By high school as many as 40\%-60\% of students become chronically disengaged from school (Klem \& Connell, 2004). Furthermore, approximately 30\% of high school students engage in multiple high-risk behaviors (e.g., substance use, sex, violence, depression, attempted suicide) that interfere with school performance and jeopardize their potential for life success (Dryfoos, 1997; Eaton et al., 2008).}

	

	\item \forGer{show that teaching social skills can help}
	\qq{Weare 2011}{Putting skills at the centre -- The centrality of [social] skills, and, in particular, work using CBT approaches to any effective mental health intervention, was strongly supported by several reviews in this study}

	\qq{Weare2011}{Skills work has been shown to be essential for effective universal interventions for mental health promotion (Adi et al 2007a); social and emotional learning (Durlak et al, 2011), targeted approaches (Shucksmith et al, 2007) depression and anxiety (Blank et al, 2009), conduct disorders (Waddell et al, 2007) violence prevention (Mytton 2002; Adi et al, 2007b) conflict resolution (Garrard and Lipsey, 2007), anger management (Gansle, 2005), bullying (Vreeman and Carroll, 2007) mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression (Neil and Christensen, 2004; Waddell et al, 2007) and emotional disturbance (Reddy et al, 2009).}

	\qq{Weare2011}{Improvements in skills were an outcome explored in 10 reviews across a wide range of issues and there was consensus among them that teaching skills and developing competence is a central part of any comprehensive and effective intervention (Catalano et al., 2002***; Berkowitz and Bier, 2007***; Durlak and Weissberg, 2007***; Shucksmith et al., 2007***)}

	\item \forGer{Define and introduce the wide range of SEL programs }
	\qq{Hoffman2009}{Generally, and for the sake of this analysis, the term SEL refers to programs that attempt to enhance EI and emotional literacy and/or the development of what are perceived to be fundamental social and emotional skills and competencies. These include such things as emotional awareness (being able to recognize and label ones own and others emotions), having the capacity to express and manage emotions appropriately, making responsible decisions or choices, establishing positive social relationships, and handling difficult interpersonal situations effectively.}
	
	\qq{Durlak2011}{Elias et al. (1997) defined SEL as the process of acquiring core competencies to recognize and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, appreciate the perspectives of others, establish and maintain positive relationships, make responsible decisions, and handle interpersonal situations con- structively. The proximal goals of SEL programs are to foster the development of five interrelated sets of cognitive, affective, and behavioral competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005).}


	\item \forGer{Continue with more details -- many developed, and already in place} -- didn't spend much time here yet, as evidence for this part will come naturally when we write the section looking at the programs in details.
	
	\qq{Durlak2011}{A recent review of U.S. school practices found that 59\% of schools already have in place programming to address the development and support of chil- drens social and emotional competencies (Foster et.al. 2005)}

	\qq{CASEL}{More than 200 programs available; other sites such as the BluePrints for prevention list selected programs}

	\qq{Weare2011, p64}{Durlak et al. calculated that the effect sizes from the 207 SEL interventions they reviewed averaged out to an 11\% improvement in achievement tests, a 25\% improvement in social and emotional skills and a 10\% decrease in class- room misbehaviour, anxiety and depression, effects which held up for at least 6 months after the intervention (Durlak et al., 2011)***.} -- Durlak2011 is a  meta-analysis of 213 school-based, universal social and emotional learning (SEL) programs involving 270,034 kindergarten through high school students.

	\qq{Sussex report}{For example, a recent meta-analysis of 180 universal promotion or prevention programmes for youths (between 5 and 18 years), including those with control group designs, found overall positive effects on social and emotional skills, self-perceptions, peer relations, violence/aggression at school, and academic achievement (Payton et al., 2008)}


	\item \forGer{Strong political support exists as well} --  add quotes and links from the mindmap ... e.g., 

	\qq{Durlak2011}{There is broad agreement among educators, policy makers, and the public that educational sys- tems should graduate students who are proficient in core academic subjects, able to work well with others from diverse backgrounds in socially and emotionally skilled ways, practice healthy behav- iors, and behave responsibly and respectfully (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2007; Greenberg et al., 2003).}

	\qq{US National Research Council}{ Recommendation: The federal government should make the healthy mental, emotional, and behavioral development of young people a national priority, establish public goals for the prevention of specific MEB disorders and for the promotion of healthy development among young people, and provide needed research and service resources to achieve these aims. (13-1)}
	
		\qq{Cherniss2006}{Some states even have passed legislation requiring school districts to incorporate social and emotional devel- opment into their educational programs and to ensure that all students meet social and emotional learning standards that have been integrated into their state learning standards.Forex- ample, based on the Childrens Mental Health Act of 2003 (Public Law93-0495), Illinois students must now meet learning standards directed toward achievement of the following three educational goals by the time they graduate from high school: (a) develop self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve school and life success; (b) use social-awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain positive relationships; and (c) demonstrate decision-making skills and responsible behaviors in personal, school, and community contexts. It is clear that educators and policy makers recognize the need to address childrens social and emotional develop- ment as an important part of education.}

		\qq{CASEL?}{Three pioneering school districts (Anchorage, Alaska; Austin, Texas; and Cleveland, Ohio) have joined an effort called the Collaborating District Initiative, through which they are working to institute SEL curricula in pre-K through 12th-grade classrooms district-wide. All three large, urban districts have installed SEL directors at the cabinet level or just below, an indication of how seriously the superintendents are taking the new approach. The Initiative will add five additional districts in the next several months.}

		\item \forGer{Summarise} -- programs are (i) needed; (ii) many exist; (iii) are effective. 

		\todo{Should we include a para that will give heads-up on the problems SEL programs are experiencing and where HCI can potentially help? Should be easy once we have the appropriate chapter ready.}



\end{itemize}

\subsection{Medical contexts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \forGer{Connect to the kids' literature, brief overview of differences} -- social skills training in medical literature focuses mainly on communication skills, various levels on which this get addressed: (i) medical students, i.e., quite general, core skills; (ii) doctors right after school \todo{there's a word for this}, i.e., more practically oriented courses, but still part of education; (iii) doctors in specific areas, where communication skills are crutial, e.g., cancer care (breaking bad news, helping patients understand and deal with the situation); (iv) care for critically ill such as end-of-life care, i.e., both nurses and doctors, importance of empathy and understanding, helping (rather then getting information, persuading. 
	
	Generally issue of time constraints, opting for shorter courses.. in contrast, some of the curricula for kids took literally years --  but reviews show that longer are much more effective $\Rightarrow$ could this be another application area for HCI, i.e., help reduce overhead, incorporate into practice etc.)

	\item \forGer{Importance of communication skills for doctors}
	 
	\qq{Reider2006}{Communication is a core clinical skill that can be taught and learned. A doctor performs 160 000 300 000 interviews during a lifetime career, making the medical interview the most commonly performed procedure in clinical medicine. [6]} -- Interestingly, Brown2008 has a different number (120 000-160 000) ... we should check with the primary source. 

	\qq{Makoul2007}{Effective communication has been linked with increases in patient and physician satisfaction, better adherence to treat- mentplans,moreappropriate medical decisions, better health outcomes, and fewer malpractice claims.3-6 }

	\qq{Brown2008}{Many studies have reported the importance of effective communication in improving patient health outcomes,[5] in fostering patient compliance to treatment [6] and in improving patient satisfaction with the medical encounter.[7,8]} 

	 \qq{Kalet2004}{Particular qualities of the doctor-patient interaction have been shown to be major determinants of the biological, psychological, social, and legal outcomes of care; efficiency and cost-effectiveness of care; iatrogenic harm created in the course of care; and patient and physician satisfaction with the relationship. 13-25}

	 Motivational interviewing .. some well chosen quote from one of the books in my office :) 

	 \qq{Back2007}{Patients with life-threateting illnesses need physicians with excellent communication skills, yet what they encounter in the physicians office is often suboptimal.[1-8] [...] The communication skills required in these settings go beyond basic interviewing taught in medical school; complex biomedical issues must be integrated with patient-centered values.}

	 \item \forGer{Need for communication skills training}
	 \qq{Brown2008}{Aspegren and Lonberg-Madsen [9] reported that doctors who had not undertaken communication skills training were unable to demonstrate important basic communication skills, even after 10 years or more of post-registration clinical work. Willis et al. [10] reported that medical students who had received CCS training had a rich conceptualisation of communication and felt that training had helped them understand the needs of their patients.}

	 \qq{Levinson2011}{Ironically, some of [modern examination technologies] have taken precedence over one of the most important skills of the compassionate physician --- the art of listening to the patient. Patients often experience physicians as being too busy to listen and too distant to care.}

	 \qq{Kalet2004}{This preclinical curricular approach provides limited reinforcement and training during the clinical years, a long-standing concern supported by the early findings of a decline in communication skills during that crucial training phase. [27] Recently, professional groups have begun to create a demand for change. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) reflect the thinking of other academic leaders that the training in these skills must be improved [28-30]. In an effort to participate in their own care, patients have also demanded that physicians communicate better [31-34].}

	 \qq{Gysels2005}{Effective communication is not something that develops automatically over time and with experience [12]. However, health professionals can be trained in communication skills [3, 13]. }

	 \qq{Tulsky2011}{Oncologists frequently miss opportunities to respond to patient emotion and may instead exhibit behaviors that block feelings and create emotional distance (8, 9).}


	 \item \forGer{Various curricula and courses implemented, and have positive outcomes}

	 \qq{Kalet2004}{U.S. medical schools generally teach communication skills during the first or second year. In 1978, 35\% of schools had a formal preclinical year curriculum in communication skills, and by 1993 the proportion had increased to 65\% of schools.26}

	 \qq{Barth2011}{The main purpose of communication skills training (CST) courses in {\bf oncology} is to increase empathy and clarity when conversing with patients and family members as well as to practise strategies on how to deal with difficult situations during consultations. In this model, communication is conceptualised as a basic set of clinical skills that can be changed during training.} ... and later ... \qq{Barth2011}{Setting and formal characteristics of CST -- 
Six studies offered training sessions over consecutive days [11, 13, 32, 36, 38, 39], whereas three studies broke down their courses into several sessions over a period of time [12, 34, 35]. In three studies, a non-continuous training (e.g. supervision, consolidation workshops) was part of the concept of the CST [18, 19, 37]. One study provided no clear information on that [33]. Concerning the intensity of the training in the specific intervention group, five CST courses lasted <24 h [18, 32, 34, 35, 38]. Five CST courses had a minimum duration of 24 h [1113, 33, 39] and three lasted $\geq$36 h [19, 36, 37].}
	
	\qq{Tulsky2011}{Courses for trainees and attending clinicians have been recently developed to address these shortcomings (1014). These multiday courses incorporate skills training, small-group practice with simulated patients, observation, and feedback (15). Such courses are effective (16) but are often time- and cost- prohibitive.}

	oncologists' programs: \qq{Stiefel2010}{it has been shown that they can be modified and improved by specific training programmes [7, 10, 1215] and (J. Barth and P. Lannen, unpublished data). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that if effective methods are used, the new skills can be transferred into a clinical setting [13] and their impact is enduring [15, 16].

	Other reviews looking into effectivity of communication interventions for doctors ... e.g., [Rao2007]


	 \item \forGer{Political support} 
	 \qq{Levinson2011}{Credentialing bodies, including the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, require trainees to demonstrate competence in communication but also should increase the required standards for teaching and assessing these skills. The American Board of Medical Specialties should incorporate assessment of communication into certification and maintenance of certification. In fact, by 2012, the American Board of Medical Specialties will require some form of peer and patient assessment in maintenance of certification program.}\

	 \qq{Makoul2007}{Education and accreditation initiatives have evolved along with the research trajectory. Indeed, the focus on communication now extends throughout the continuum of medical education and practice: US and Canadian medical schools must teach and assess communication skills to maintain accreditation, and interpersonal and communication skills are considered a core area of competency for both residents and practicing physicians.11-13}


	 \item CAUTIONARY NOTE: Most of the literature I have above (for medical contexts) looked mainly at doctors, not medical students curricula. Need to search a bit and add this later.

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Social skills and successful social relationships extremely important -- pull  emotional intelligence, the loneliness neuroscience results etc?
   \item 
	\item Political arguments, numbers, dolars, long-term positive outcomes. 
	\item ``This fits well with the Being Human support of values'' arguemtns?
	\item a timely topic, in view of both the maturing technology, as well as the recent emphasis on these programs from US government and other bodies? Also timely in view of the recent surge in social neuroscience results, looking more and more on relationships/interaction than individual emotional processing (pull the Goleman here as well?/also mentioned in the NIH report). 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item when was CASEL started? 
		\item other organisations like blueprints for violence prevention
	\end{itemize}
	\item \todo{How to deal with medical vs. educational focus here?} ... more generally, do we want to have these two fields as examples why it makes sense to support social skills (as a general topic), or as the main drivers for what we are proposing? 
	\item for medical personnel -- distinction between core curriculum for medical students vs. courses for particular classes of doctors (e.g., oncologists etc.) 
	\item where should we emphasise the "social" aspect of what we are proposing? That is, focus on interpersonal interaction, at least dyads etc. Is this inherent in the problems SEL/medical courses try to solve? (keeping cool in situations/doctors' discussions with patients).
