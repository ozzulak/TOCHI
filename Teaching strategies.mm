The first step in this process is to help children be able to accu- rately label and express their own feelings to others. Through the use of laminated cue cards and videotapes of children demonstrat- ing various emotions, children discuss and learn about a wide range of feeling states. The unit begins with basic sad, angry, happy, and scared feelings and progresses to more complex feelings such as frustration, excite- ment, disappointment, and embarrassment. The children are helped to recognize their own feelings by checking their bodies and faces for &#x201c;tight&#x201d;(tense) muscles, relaxed mus- cles, frowns, smiles, and sensations in other parts of their bodies (eg, butterflies in their stomachs). Matching the facial expressions and body postures shown on cue cards helps the children to recognize the cues from their own bodies and associate a word with these feelings."/>

Given the high demands on teachers, English language arts (ELA) and history are the most practical subject areas in which to incorporate an SEL curriculum that centers on literature, writing, and understand- ing human experience. ELA lessons, for example, invariably involve characters that experience a myriad of emotional experiences that need to be recognized, understood, labeled, expressed, and regulated.
